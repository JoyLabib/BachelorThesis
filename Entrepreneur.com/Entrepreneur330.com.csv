0,How Mindset Plays a Role in Your Entrepreneurial Success,"Apr 23, 2024",Joseph Camberato,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-mindset-plays-a-role-in-your-entrepreneurial-success/472788,"
When you consider the different factors that contribute to your success as an entrepreneur, mindset may not be the first thing that comes to mind. Mindset may not seem important as you move from task to task, but it has a significant impact on how you run your business.Successful entrepreneurs have a different mindset than everyone else, and it affects how they run their businesses.Let's look at seven mindset shifts you must embrace as an entrepreneur and why each one matters.Related: Why Mindset Matters for Success1. Reframe failureMany people believe that failure is the opposite of success, but failure is actually a necessary step toward success. Failure is a part of every entrepreneur's journey — Walt Disney, Steve Jobs and Arianna Huffington all experienced significant setbacks. What matters is how you react to failure and turn it into something positive.



Look at every setback as an opportunity to learn something new and practice resilience. Failure is often the catalyst for innovation — research shows that companies that encourage risk-taking and try new ideas perform better in the market.2. Thinking bigSuccessful entrepreneurs have big, ambitious goals for their businesses. The best way to achieve more is to set higher goals and push yourself beyond what you believe is possible.Most people get into entrepreneurship because they are naturally big thinkers. However, it's easy to lose this mindset when you're focused on your business's daily operations. To some extent, this is normal — your employees have to get paid, and there are daily to-do lists that must be completed.But if you aren't careful, you can lose sight of your bigger vision for your business. Thinking big helps you break out of this mindset and see opportunities you might have missed otherwise.


3. Take calculated risksIt's impossible to start a business or launch a product without some degree of risk, so entrepreneurs need to get good at taking calculated risks. When you take a calculated risk, you accept a certain likelihood of failure because it can potentially move your business forward. It's an informed decision based on market data, not a haphazard choice based on feelings.The key is learning when it pays to take a risk and when it doesn't. Start developing a decision-making framework to help you lay out the facts, evaluate your options, make a decision and commit to seeing it through.4. Continue learningThe most successful entrepreneurs are known for embracing continuous learning. For example, Bill Gates is known for being a voracious reader and regularly shares thoughts on his favorite books. When he goes on vacation, he spends about three hours a day reading and taking notes as he reads.Continuous learning can take many different forms, such as reading, attending industry events or taking courses. Expanding your knowledge and honing your skills gives you an edge over your competitors.

Embrace a growth mindsetThe term growth mindset refers to an individual's belief that their skills and abilities can improve with effort. In comparison, individuals with a fixed mindset believe that their personality and abilities are fixed traits that don't really change.A growth mindset gives you the resilience to adapt and move through challenging situations. It allows you to learn from mistakes and find the necessary resources to grow your business.If you want to launch a new product, a growth mindset allows you to test and iterate on your idea. Instead of viewing negative feedback or slow sales as a sign you should give up, you can use this feedback to improve your product offering.


6. Focus on providing valueSuccessful entrepreneurs focus on providing value rather than just making more money. This can be a challenging mindset shift to make because we all need money to pay our bills and buy the things we want.But when you focus on making money as your end goal, it's easy to become short-sighted and make every decision based on maximizing your profits now. If your customers don't receive value from your products or services, you can't build a sustainable business long-term.7. ResourcefulnessWhen you're starting a business, time and money are almost always in short supply, and unexpected problems will arise. You have to learn to be resourceful and find creative solutions to problems.Being resourceful also means being flexible and willing to adapt to a constantly changing environment. For example, the most resourceful entrepreneurs were able to pivot during Covid-19, adjust their business strategy and identify new opportunities.

While those things are certainly important, it's easy to overlook the importance of mindset when you're starting or growing a business.Your mindset matters because it shapes your decisions and actions. By embracing the seven mindset shifts outlined in this article, you'll set your business up for even greater success.

Today, Joshua Britton is the founder and CEO of Debut, a biotechnology company delivering ""high-performing"" cosmetic bioactive ingredients ""at unprecedented speed."" But before the startup began to innovate in the biotech space, it was just an idea, one that stemmed from ""some academic research,"" ""a lucky Uber ride"" and a ""vision for the beauty industry,"" Britton says.Image Credit: Billy Economou, BE Studios. Joshua Britton.Britton completed his Ph.D. in biochemistry and organic chemistry before furthering his studies at University of California, Irvine. Afterward, he decided to apply what he'd learned to ""this new thing called cell-free and synthetic biology,"" which refers to the processes within biotechnology that enable the creation or modification of biological organisms. Essentially, enzymes or microbes can be ""taught"" how to make powerful ingredients — including plant or flower molecules — in a reactor in a lab setting.



Naturally, the process comes with massive implications for the multi-billion-dollar beauty industry, which relies on natural ingredients for fragrance and other properties. Britton decided it was time to bring the biotech mainstream. But, of course, he also needed to fund the venture. While working at the back of his professor's lab by day, he had a side hustle driving for Uber at night to earn some extra cash. When he got to talking with one passenger and pitched her his idea, she was sold — and wrote him a $100,000 check to support his efforts.Related: EntrepreneurTV Is Now Live — and Free. Start Streaming and Get Inspired.


Britton's passenger would be Debut's first investor, but certainly not its last: The company raised $22.6 million in a Series A round led by Material Impact in 2021 and $40 million in a Series B round led by BOLD, the venture capital fund of L'Oréal, the world's largest cosmetics company, last year.""Whenever people want [fragrance] products, they have to effectively use agriculture to get them.""Debut has already brought the technology to market with a consumer skincare brand called Deinde, which targets inflammaging, a process associated with the aging of the human body. The products contain Naringenin, a potent polyphenol typically found in grapefruit peel that's been clinically proven to strengthen the skin barrier and reduce inflammation. According to Britton, the clinical claims allow for ""product differentiation in market,"" and many brands are coming to Debut as they seek to convert from other mainstays like Vitamin C, niacinamide and squalane.But fragrance will be Debut's next frontier, a move that coincides with growing consumer demand for transparency and natural ingredients — and concerns over the beauty industry's impact on dwindling natural resources. The majority of fragrance ingredients from fragrance houses are cultivated, perhaps from the ""from the lavender fields of France"" or the roots of a certain type of tree, Britton says, which requires land, water and agrochemical use.


Related: Jeans Made Out of…What? One Company Dared to Go Where None Had Before — and Even Levi's Is On Board.""Whenever people want these products, they have to effectively use agriculture to get them,"" Britton explains. ""The fragrance industry has been very good at hiding the fact that the majority of fragrances are actually chemically derived. If you dig pretty deep into them, you'll find that they're made from petroleum-based synthesis. And that's just what we're looking to change.""""There could be 200 or 300 compounds in there all at different levels. And you have to be able to mimic that exactly in a bioreactor.""When it comes to fragrance, Debut is all about ""mimicking nature."" Sometimes, that means mirroring a single ingredient, a process that's not unlike making wine or beer, where a watery, sugary solution is mixed with a cell, but instead of producing wine or beer, it produces a fragrance model, Britton explains. It's a method that involves limited land use, no agrochemicals and ""very little waste.""


Of course, some scents ""are very complex mixtures"" that require a careful balance of different notes — and Debut has developed the technology to replicate those as well, Britton says. ""The nose is so sensitive that if you have a fragrance from a root, for example, what you'll see is there could be 200 or 300 compounds in there all at different levels,"" he explains. ""And you have to be able to mimic that exactly in a bioreactor. If you [don't], then you won't have the same smell, and the product won't be successful.""Related: The Future of Food: How Biotech Will Save Us AllDebut is all about putting successful products in the hands of consumers — foregoing biotech's standard horizontal integration model, whereby companies seek out a scientific solution that's then produced at a very small scale for a vertical one that emphasizes the end consumer and product from the start, according to Britton.""When we think about how to bring synthetic biology to people, it's in the form of tangible products,"" Britton says. ""That means that we have to not only do groundbreaking research but also interact with our consumers and users. We have to understand how to make formulations. We have to make physical products.""

2,Your Work Ethic Is Not the Problem — Debunking Three Modern-Day Productivity Myths,"Apr 22, 2024",Aytekin Tank,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/lets-debunk-these-3-modern-day-productivity-myths/471744,"
In ancient Greece, philosophers like Plato and Aristotle were already grappling with the notion of work-life balance. The latter described amusement as a remedy for the ""ills of work,"" which he said was accompanied by ""toil and strain."" Work, they acknowledged, was necessary for living a virtuous life — and paying for stuff — but it shouldn't be the end, in and of itself.Nearly two-and-a-half millennia later, we still struggle to define what constitutes a good life and how work and productivity factor in. Our modern-day hustle culture, and many of today's outspoken business leaders, would have you believe that more is more. A steely, unwavering work ethic is a requisite for success. Sleep can wait, so the thinking goes.But a growing body of research plus some innovative companies are showing that the truth about productivity is more nuanced. More isn't always more — but working long hours isn't always bad either. There are no hard and fast rules.

        Some people are making six-figure incomes by secretly working multiple remote jobs.
      


        But some critics aren't sure job juggling is ethical since remote roles are in high demand.
      


        Six people who've benefited from ""overemployment"" described why they don't feel guilty.

Some people are making six-figure incomes secretly working multiple remote gigs. They don't feel guilty about it. None of the workers in the story are pictured.


 This article originally appeared on Business Insider. If you could double your income by secretly working multiple remote jobs, would you do it?What if it required keeping a secret from your bosses and coworkers? What if you landed a second job over someone who was looking for their first?Would you feel bad?""Overemployed"" workers have a resounding answer: No.Over the past year, Business Insider has spoken with more than 10 job jugglers who used their six-figure earnings to pay off debt, plan for an early retirement, and afford expensive vacations and weight-loss drugs. But not everyone is a fan of the overemployed.Some critics have questioned the ethics of job juggling, arguing that employees shouldn't be doing work for one company when they're being paid by another. While some employers may be OK with their workers taking on another role, doing so without approval could be a fireable offense if a worker is caught.There's also the question of what it means for someone to be taking a second remote job when the market for these roles is so competitive.



The share of U.S. remote job postings on LinkedIn fell from over 20% in April 2022 to about 10% in December 2023. LinkedIn said that despite the decline, remote roles accounted for 46% of all applications in December.Remote jobs have grown particularly competitive in the tech industry, a common field for overemployed workers. In 2023, tech companies including Amazon, Meta, and Google laid off close to 263,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. Roughly 50,000 tech workers have been laid off since the start of this year.Business Insider asked six current and former overemployed workers whether they felt guilty about their job juggling. They shared their experiences via email on the condition that pseudonyms would be used, for fear of professional repercussions. BI has verified their identities and earnings.If companies can lay off workers on a whim, workers should be able to seek out extra job securityJoseph, a Gen X network engineer, told Business Insider he earned $344,000 in 2022 secretly working three remote jobs. He said the extra income allowed him to pay off the remaining $129,000 on his mortgage.


At first, Joseph said, his wife was not a fan of his job juggling because she thought he was taking a job away from someone who needed one. But last year, he said, they both learned the value of having multiple gigs.Joseph was laid off from two of his jobs — he said that it wasn't for performance reasons and that his job juggling was never exposed. If he hadn't had three jobs, he could have been left with no job at all.This made it hard for him to feel very guilty about being overemployed. ""It's huge that I still have this third job,"" he said.Joseph isn't the only overemployed worker who values job security.


Robert, a Gen Xer living in Florida, told Business Insider he earned roughly $335,000 last year juggling multiple jobs — he said the extra income helped him pay for a roughly $20,000 cruise.Given that layoffs across the tech industry have left some workers scrambling to find new roles, Robert said no one should be blamed for trying to protect themselves.""If companies can so easily cut you off like many have these days, then shouldn't you have the ability to be resilient and resistant to layoffs and cuts in protecting the best interests of your family?"" he said.If CEOs can work for multiple businesses, employees should be able to as wellJohn, a millennial IT professional in California, told Business Insider he was on track to earn over $300,000 last year across two remote jobs.


He said that he'd saved roughly $150,000 since he started job juggling in 2021 and that he spent roughly $9,000 on a three-week honeymoon across Asia last year.John said he didn't feel guilty about having multiple jobs because he wasn't violating any labor laws or employment contracts, adding that his company was happy with the work he was doing.He also thinks there's a double standard in the corporate world.He said it's not uncommon for CEOs like Elon Musk, for instance, to juggle roles with multiple companies, whether as an executive or part of a board.""No one ever thinks that's wrong,"" John said. ""I'm the same. I am the CEO of my own labor, and I choose to spend my labor on multiple projects.""William, a Texas-based tech worker in his 30s who told Business Insider he earned over $500,000 in 2022 secretly working multiple remote roles, agreed with this line of thinking.""I knew plenty of high-level executives that also had consulting business or other ventures as well,"" he said.While there has been some pushback against CEO job juggling, the practice is still generally accepted in the corporate world. People with the money and resources of Musk, for example, may find it easier to multitask than the typical white-collar worker.


If you do your job well and efficiently, you should be able to have other jobs on the sideSteven, a UK-based project manager in his mid-20s, told Business Insider he was earning roughly $90,000 a year secretly working two full-time hybrid project-manager jobs.He said overemployment was the only way he could start paying down his debt. As of late last year, he had roughly $30,000 worth of credit-card debt and $50,000 in various loans.Steven said he didn't feel guilty about job juggling because he was still able to complete all the duties and tasks assigned to him. He argued that if an employee can get their work done with plenty of time to spare, they should be able to pursue other job opportunities.""What if an employee supposedly working a 40-hour week, for example, only has actually 20 hours of work to do?"" he said. ""What would they do then? Sit in front of the computer waiting for something or wasting time on their phone or emails? Is that better in any way than my choosing to fit a second job in and get some benefit out of all this otherwise dead free time?""


Other job jugglers described similar sentiments.""In a salaried position, you are paid based on objectives, not by time,"" William said. ""Based on that, there is not a situation of double billing, and overemployment is not too different than picking up the extra slack from another coworker.""Perhaps counterintuitively, workers having extra jobs could actually benefit some companies, said Justin, a Gen Xer who told Business Insider he earned over $300,000 in 2022 secretly working three full-time remote IT-engineer jobs.Justin said he didn't feel guilty about job juggling because he was a top performer in all his roles — and having multiple jobs gave him experience that added value to all his employers.


""Having the 'same job times three' helps me increase knowledge to be a better worker everywhere,"" he said.

        Goodfriend turned his passion for food tours into a business with some encouragement from his friends. 
      


        The business made about $30,000 a year before Goodfriend was laid off from Meta and went full-time with the venture.
      


        Goodfriend appreciates being able to ""pursue something I love and earn a salary from it.""
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Scott Goodfriend, who was working as an executive producer in New York City when he launched Ultimate Food Tours. Goodfriend coordinates food tours all over New York City, ""allowing the participants to experience the city's culinary scene in a whole new light.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Ultimate Food Tours. Scott Goodfriend. When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? I moved to New York from Los Angeles in 2011. I always loved traveling and getting lost walking through different cities. When I moved to New York, I was fascinated by the ability to visit anywhere in the world by subway, even neighborhoods that were far away. I researched different restaurants and then started thinking, well, maybe I can eat at a few different places, so I started planning walking routes to different eateries on Google Maps. My friends found out I was doing this and wanted to join.



Eventually, the word spread. My friends and family from out of town started calling me when they came to visit New York. They would tell me about a neighborhood they wanted to explore and ask if I could plan a food tour. I enjoyed the challenge and was happy to do this, and I probably ended up planning 50-100 tours over seven or so years.Related: TV Shows All Entrepreneurs Should Be Watching


During this entire time, I was a broke freelance TV producer living in the East Village who lived off a fair amount of $1 pizza. I lived close to Chinatown and figured I could probably take a short walk and find something better. I not only found delicious food but also discovered the variety, depth and complexity of Chinese food, which I became obsessed with. I started doing tons of research into the regions, cuisines and history and the Chinese experience on the Lower East Side. I started taking people to Chinatown, and they fell in love with the tour. They told me to do this as a business, and I always poo-pooed the idea, saying I didn't want to build a website or do the marketing (sweet, sweet irony — but more on that later). My friend encouraged me to put my tour on something called Airbnb Experiences. I posted the Chinatown tour on Airbnb in 2019; it got to the top of Airbnb in a short timeframe. Then, Covid-19 hit, which shut my operations down for over a year.In 2021, I reworked the tour and put it back on Airbnb, and it got to the top of the ""Activities to do in NYC"" list. People started asking me what other tours I had, so I wrote more. Eventually, I had to hire people to help run the tours and help with the marketing. It got overwhelming because I was also working my dream job as an augmented reality producer at Meta, but then….I was part of the Meta layoffs in 2023! I had a decision to make: Go work for another company I really loved and respected, or pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I decided to pursue Ultimate Food Tours full-time. It's been great, and I've learned so much doing it. I am really glad I made the jump.Related: This Dad Started a Side Hustle to Save for His Daughter's College Fund — Then It Earned $1 Million and Caught Apple's Attention


What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?The biggest challenge while building my business was deciding where to focus and invest my time. You need to be strategic about what parts of the business you invest in and focus on. Since entrepreneurship doesn't have a playbook, the answer is often to go for it, analyze the results, learn from it and do better next time.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?Ultimate Food Tours evolved tremendously over the last few years, and I'm lucky enough for it to be my full-time job now. Before switching to this as a full-time role, I was making around $30,000 a year. I probably saw consistent revenue between the second and third years. At this time, I was only pursuing Ultimate Food Tours on the weekends, so I was making around several thousand dollars a month.What does total annual revenue look like now?Currently, I generate around $200,000 a year and have seen the brand grow by about three times year-over-year.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


What do you enjoy most about this side hustle? I love being able to leverage my passions and turn them into business strategies. A great example of this is our content marketing. I come from a family of foodies, and I have always loved history and making videos, so I created a social series called Origin Stories, which tells the history behind New York's famous foods and the best places to eat them. We have three seasons and plan to begin long-form content soon. I am so proud of this because we get to use our platform to drive traffic to local restaurants while simultaneously building our own brand. It's conceptualizing and executing these win-win strategies that really got me excited about running a business.Being an entrepreneur is a lifestyle! When I first started, I was putting in around 20 hours a week. Since making my side gig my full-time job, I probably work between 50-60 hours a week. Combining my passion with my livelihood allows me the flexibility to pursue something I love and earn a salary from it. I also utilize outside technology that helps streamline my finances and save me time to focus on my business and personal life.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Stay organized! It's easy to get overwhelmed with various spreadsheets and different numbers flying around. Using an accounting sofware helps free up time on my schedule, allowing me to turn my attention to other areas of the business like marketing and developing additional tours.Whatever idea you have, whatever your big dream is, take that first step now! Buy that domain name, make that social media post, whatever it is. Just do one small thing a day, and the rest will fall into place. Make it part of your routine, and you'll see a return.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


If you're working a full-time job, try to bite off what you can chew and plan your side hustle schedule around your current commitments. You'll be able to see if it has room to grow, and if you do think you want to make it your full-time thing, start putting things in place that prepare you to make the jump when you feel ready.Network and talk to other entrepreneurs! The most valuable thing I found was talking to other people who started businesses and food tour companies of their own. They knew what needed to be done and were able to fill in a lot of the gaps in managing my time and gave me the insights needed to successfully launch my own business.

5,They Designed One Simple Product With a 'Focus on Human Health' — and Made $40 Million Last Year,"Apr 18, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/simple-health-focused-product-led-to-40m-in-revenue-in-2023/472859,"
Branch Basics founders Marilee Nelson, Allison Evans and Kelly Love ""never set out to sell soap,"" let alone launch a cleaning brand that would generate tens of millions in annual sales.But the company's ""mission to create healthy homes"" while keeping cleaning routines simple continues to resonate with customers — 50% of whom are returning, according to the brand. Among other select accessories, Branch Basics offers a comprehensive ""starter kit,"" which features a fragrance-free, ""plant- and mineral-based"" cleaning concentrate along with various glass bottles that can be filled with different combinations of the solution and water to meet specific needs: from wiping down a bathroom counter to doing a load of laundry.Image Credit: Courtesy of Branch Basics. Marilee Nelson, left; Allison Evans, center; Kelly Love, right.



The story of how the company came to be begins with Nelson, who, after battling chronic illness, was told that she'd never have kids and needed to go on dialysis. Nelson wasn't sold on the prognosis and turned to another doctor who used ""food as medicine"" — a leap of faith that ""literally changed her life,"" eradicating those health issues and even inspiring her to become a medicinal cook. Later, after her 10-year-old son was exposed to pesticides and suffered brain and immune system damage, she took another hard look at environmental factors that might contribute to healing.""His immune system had been so damaged that he could not detoxify the things we're all exposed to every day,"" Nelson says, ""and he would have extreme reactions. I took one box and thought, Oh, I'll keep my favorite perfumes in here, favorite skincare products and things, in the closet, and when he gets better, I will bring them back out."" However, according to Nelson, the box's removal made such a significant difference that it showed her ""how important it is to [recognize] how powerful these chemicals are."" Nelson's son started to heal, and when word of mouth spread, she developed a course to help other people better understand the products in their homes.

Diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, Evans was told by doctors that ""no lifestyle change"" could help her heal and to take birth control indefinitely; in college, she faced a range of symptoms — muscle aches, loss of motor skills and more — and says she was prescribed numerous medications to no avail. At the time, Evans and her aunt Marilee weren't particularly close, but she consulted with her and realized that some simple lifestyle changes just might help her feel better.According to Evans, removing certain products with synthetic ingredients and eating whole foods did help her condition improve, and as graduation neared, she decided to spend eight weeks with Nelson in the Texas Hill Country, where she'd learn more about healthy living from her aunt. Her friend Kelly joined her, and despite being in good health, also noticed a transformation — ""My dry itchy eyes, headaches, muscle aches are all gone,"" Love recalls, adding, ""the more I learned about all this, it just made sense to me: Of course, the type of fuel we put in our bodies matters for how we feel, how we think, how we act.""

The organization also notes that even naturally occurring fragrances, such as citrus, ""can react to produce dangerous pollutants indoors.""


""Nontoxic"" labels on products aren't the be-all and end-all either, Nelson notes.

6,How to Escape Entrepreneurial Burnout When You Can't Just Quit,"Apr 18, 2024",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-escape-entrepreneurial-burnout-when-you-cant-quit/471967,"
I have experienced burnout before as an entrepreneur. Yes, burnout is an extremely common topic. A quick search mostly shows tips on how to avoid it, which is great until you find yourself in the middle of it. In fact, I found that when I actually experienced it for myself, few resources gave me an answer that would work with my life.The number one answer I found online? If you're experiencing burnout, quit your job. For someone who owns a business, that's not so easy. Now, it's not impossible to get rid of your business and change career paths. If you want to do that, you certainly can.However, being an entrepreneur certainly follows the idiom: in for a penny, in for a pound. Most business owners I know are all in. There is no other career for them. Finances, schedules and other people's lives are all tied to a business. Stepping away is not always an option.



So, what do you do when you're experiencing burnout as an entrepreneur and you feel like your entire career is on life support as you barely make it through each day?Related: 3 Insights From the First Large-Scale Study on Burnout and Entrepreneurs


Address the root issueTake a moment to determine what is causing you the most stress. Pinpoint a few key stress-inducing areas. Perhaps it is a single client. Run through the numbers — can you part ways with that client? Are they worth the hassle? And if they are a larger client, you can come up with a plan to find someone else to replace that revenue stream. Businesses are always changing. You are not required to have the same clients for 10 years, 20 years or even a single year. Some companies and some clients do not work well with each other, and that is okay.Perhaps you just feel as though you've lost passion for the job. Do you feel bogged down with menial tasks? Maybe you're a more creative person, but as your business has grown, you've found yourself stuck with things like scheduling meetings and following up on emails. You should hire a virtual assistant. They can share the load and get smaller items off your plate so you can focus on what you love to do.Maybe you've just lost sight of your ""why"" along the way: You don't remember why you started your business or what made you passionate about it. Try going down memory lane — look through old photos or social media posts, talk to people who knew you before you started your business, and maybe even see if you can find some notes from when you first started. This can help you get a little perspective back on the company so that you can make a plan to get back to your original mission.While I would love to say take a week off from work to really sit with yourself and review what's going on, I understand that's not always possible. Pick a holiday or your slowest time of the year. Block off some time as though you are in a meeting and figure out what the root cause of your burnout is, and then make a plan on how to change things so you do not experience it again.


Protect your healthAbove all else, protect your health. According to the Mayo Clinic, burnout is a serious health concern. You don't just feel tired and sluggish — your entire body is suffering and will show signs such as exhaustion, loss of sleep, mood changes and more. Burnout can quite literally turn you into a different person if you are not careful.And, if you continue to try and push through it, you will find that your body will stop you by making you get sicker more often, or even causing you to develop a serious issue such as heart disease. Burnout should not be taken lightly.I want to provide a bit of a warning: If you've realized that you do need to step away from your business to stay healthy, then you should do so. That is not an easy decision, but at the end of the day, you need to protect your health. As entrepreneurs, we are driven by our businesses and often feel obligated to clients, so it might help to reframe it like this: Losing you to a serious disease will cause more problems for friends, family, employees and clients versus you deciding you need to step away to stay healthy and ultimately happy.Related: How Entrepreneurs Can Protect Their Mental Health While Being Their Own BossOn the other hand, if you want to keep your company and find ways around burnout, try these solutions:Consider seeking therapy. Sometimes pushing yourself to burnout can be a symptom of larger issues that a medical professional can help with.Set boundaries. You are your own worst enemy, and you will work too hard, pushing yourself to impossible deadlines that maybe not even your clients have asked for. Set times to work and set times to step away from work. Good clients who recognize the value your business brings will honor those times.Take a break. You might not be able to work a full vacation into your schedule, but you can set 10 to 15-minute breaks throughout the day to just breathe.Work out your stress. Although you may feel exhausted and sluggish, burnout is actually just another type of stress, which means it can be relieved through physical activities such as walks or high-intensity workouts.If you find yourself suffering from burnout, don't give up hope. Instead, give your career some CPR and get it off life support by reaching out to others for help so that you can protect your health and your business.

Responses have been edited and condensed for clarity.Image Credit: Courtesy of CCRSP INC. Dr. Amareen Dhaliwal. How were you introduced to EdTech, and what inspired you to start your side hustle in that space?When I had the opportunity to tutor STEM classes in college, I quickly realized teaching was my passion. I excelled on the newly formatted MCAT and decided I wanted to help students achieve higher scores (one of my students even reached the 99th percentile!). A college friend suggested I create a pre-med club focused on innovative learning experiences, which sparked my interest in curriculum development and the use of learning management systems supported by professionals in medical and scientific fields. The idea to build a website and offer tutoring services emerged after I hosted a successful MCAT seminar, and my commitment to tutoring in college laid the foundation for my future endeavors.



My tutoring venture expanded into a holistic coaching experience, which focused on the psychology of studying, anxiety management and wellness, including the utilization of 24-hour planners, exercise and nutrition. This comprehensive approach led me to pursue a psychiatry residency. Despite not initially seeing myself as a business person, the need for innovation in MCAT preparation drove me to entrepreneurship.Related: Best New Shows for Entrepreneurs (Streaming Free)


After collaborating with peers in clinical trials, we launched online clinical research courses, aiming for excellence and continuous improvement. This endeavor was more than a business; it was about making a meaningful impact and addressing broader needs. CCRPS INC was founded to address the underemployment of foreign medical graduates and healthcare professionals in the U.S. despite their impressive credentials. Together with colleagues in clinical trials, we aimed to provide educational courses to help these individuals secure entry-level positions that offer both competitive salaries and a sense of purpose. We established a strong online presence, developed expert-led courses and focused on education and career preparation. Our commitment to quality content quickly earned us recognition and trust, positioning CCRPS as a leader in the field.What were some of the first steps you took to get CCRPS off the ground?First, we identified our niche by recognizing a gap for non-clinical medical professionals seeking valuable career paths. We built a user-friendly website and formed partnerships with providers, building trust by seeking out video and audio reviews from graduate students to help other students have a better idea of our comprehensive and in-depth educational approach. We collaborated with experts to create high-quality course materials and secured the necessary accreditations to establish credibility. We also offered comprehensive career support and focused on quality education, which spurred organic growth through referrals and a robust online presence.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the side hustle, and how did you navigate them?Building and growing a startup requires constant ""figuring out"" of challenges. The biggest challenge was meeting and surpassing our clients' needs so they could continue to grow. Additionally, delegating to the right people requires trial and error; you can't expect to get it right from day one! The key to overcoming these challenges is learning to be okay with the ups and downs, being the rock when changes don't go as planned and consistently providing excellent services.Related: This Insurance Agent Started a Side Hustle Inspired By Nostalgia for His Home State — Now It Earns Nearly $40,000 a Month


How long did it take you to see consistent revenue from your work within EdTech?From the outset, our business achieved net profitability, a testament to our compelling curriculum. Starting with one in-person student whose enrollment funded our initial website and SEO efforts, we adopted a strategy that allowed us to reinvest early profits into expanding our operations. This approach was essential in both our foundational stages and as we scaled, particularly with the MCAT company.Despite promising early enrollments, our focus has always been on student success and quality education rather than merely generating revenue. This commitment enabled us to reduce prices over time, making education more accessible and aligning with our belief in the importance of affordable education. Engaging students meaningfully requires commitment, evidenced by our successful partnerships with contract research organizations and our lean yet effective operational model.How do you balance your entrepreneurial pursuits with a demanding career in medicine?Following a year-long hiatus to launch CCRPS, I transitioned back into my residency. Today, brilliant clinical research professionals and a solid team manage the day-to-day operations and business aspects, ensuring student success remains a priority at CCRPS while I fully immerse myself and focus on my residency.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


What do you enjoy most about running your own business?I appreciate the profound influence I can have on students' success and career advancement. Witnessing their growth, seeing their achievements and knowing that we play a pivotal role in shaping their futures is incredibly rewarding and reaffirms my passion for education entrepreneurship every day. With over 22,000 student members from more than 1,200 organizations, including six government agencies and 308 universities, the reach and influence of CCRPS are evident. A 2024 LinkedIn review of graduates highlighted remarkable outcomes, with placements in over 1,600 companies and 23% achieving managerial roles or higher. Furthermore, the initiative has significantly contributed to developing the clinical research workforce for various contract research organizations. This progress, driven by a team of exceptional clinical research educators, underscores the collective effort and dedication to advancing clinical trials and healthcare.What's your advice for others hoping to start successful businesses?Learning how to harness and delegate our strengths effectively is crucial. Sometimes, guidance from those who've walked the path before us can be a game-changer; seeking expert mentorship in areas we find challenging can make all the difference.Start small and focus on what matters: In a world brimming with startups, it's vital to remember that at the heart of every idea and venture are the people we aim to help. They are our priority, always. Let's embrace our unique talents, lean into learning and always put people first.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

Ninety-five percent of workers are looking for or plan to look for a new job this year, according to a report from job-search website Monster. If you're one of them, it might be worth your time to check out LinkedIn's Top Companies for 2024 — because they're all hiring, with more than 85,000 current job openings, one-third of which are hybrid.LinkedIn's annual compilation of data can help professionals find out which organizations are industry leaders making an impact with growth opportunities, equity in the workplace and more. Each company on LinkedIn's list was ranked according to eight pillars that translate to career progression: ability to advance, skills growth, company stability, external opportunity, company affinity, gender diversity, educational background and employee presence in the country, per the platform.Related: LinkedIn Changed Its Algorithms — Here's How Your Posts Will Get More Attention Now



""This year, companies in financial services, healthcare and tech dominate the U.S. ranking, driven in part by pandemic rebounding and overall stability within these sectors despite layoff headlines for some big-name companies,"" the company said in a statement, which also noted that 44% of the companies included in the 2024 ranking are new to the list and represent a range of industries including motor vehicle manufacturing and biotechnology research.Several key trends emerged across this year's top companies. They're embracing the power of artificial intelligence, relying on AI for meeting summarization, code generation, customer service assistance, predictive analytics, modeling and more; cultivating academic communities with an AI focus; and even creating their own AI platforms and governance teams, per LinkedIn.


The top companies are also on the hunt for soft skills like adaptability, curiosity, collaboration and communication, and they're aiming to center company culture and connection, according to the research. Some examples include Wells Fargo, which hosts events like puppy-petting with local dog foster organizations as part of its Stress Down Days program, and PwC, which encourages breaks by outfitting its offices with gaming areas that include foosball, shuffleboard, basketball and more.Related: Unlocking the Power of LinkedIn: How Entrepreneurs Can Leverage the Platform for Growth and SuccessBut perhaps one of the most significant developments for employees? That might be these top companies' mission to ""uplevel"" compensation packages. When asked to rank the most important factors in a job, 45% of workers said pay took the No. 1 spot, a Washington Post-Ipsos poll found. Although many would consider salary the backbone of any compensation package, the top companies on LinkedIn's list also look beyond pay when it comes to their ""robust compensation packages.""JPMorgan Chase & Co. (#1) provides financial coaching to help employees earn and save more; General Motors (#11) offers upskilling initiatives like the Geek Program technical competitive events and tuition assistance; the American Express (#49) Colleague Networks feature international buddy programs and informal coffee chats to increase employee visibility with leadership; Continental (#29) implements job rotations for internal mobility, including short- and long-term international assignments; and Procter & Gamble (#22) wants team members to have the opportunity for ""several careers within a career,"" per LinkedIn.

10,I Built a $1 Million Business While Overcoming a Disability — Here's How I Did It,"Apr 15, 2024",Trevor Rappleye,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/i-built-a-1-million-business-while-overcoming-a-disability/470920,"
My story is a rollercoaster of highs, lows and everything in between. I've been the founder and CEO of a booming seven-figure video production business, FranchiseFilming.com, since 2020. We help franchisors share their journeys through authentic storytelling that drives franchise development. I've been filming since I was 13 — back when VHS and DVD were still a thing — and it's been my one true passion in life. I've never had another job.But trust me, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. I had to fight tooth and nail to get here, starting with a struggle that initially seemed insurmountable — my stutter.Related: Considering franchise ownership? Get started now and take this survey to find your personalized list of franchises that match your lifestyle, interests and budget.Daily ridiculeAs you can imagine, growing up with a stutter wasn't a walk in the park. I faced daily ridicule and bullying and it took a toll on me. My 6th-grade teacher, Mrs. Andrews, would let me leave the classroom when it was time to read out loud — Yes, kids have to learn to be tough, but the ridicule every day was hard. Once, in junior high, everyone was required to speak in front of the class. While everyone else took two minutes, I took what felt like 15 minutes to get through my speech. We all know how mean kids can be and they were all laughing at me. But I refused to let it beat me down — I decided to face my speech impediment head-on.



It wasn't easy.There is no sure way to correct a stutter — some people can train their vocal cords to not stop and some can't — all one can do is go to therapy and practice. Fortunately, my parents always believed in me and spent the time and money on therapy to make sure I improved. I was just as determined to solve my stutter. Every day throughout junior high and high school, I would choose a random chapter of a book from school and read it out loud.Related: 6 Famous People Who Have Overcome Stuttering


First speaking engagementWhen I became a successful business owner, I realized another hurdle was waiting for me: public speaking. I was honored to begin receiving invitations to speak at various franchise-related events in 2022. I was also terrified. But instead of hiding behind my fear, I decided to own it. I embraced my authenticity, stutter and all.The night before I spoke at my first franchise conference I was so nervous and so scared that I almost drafted an email saying I had COVID and could not go. I was up all night pacing around my apartment, practicing my opening. I walked out on my balcony, smelled the air and I started crying. I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of the entire industry. I woke up my partner and he said I was being ridiculous and went back to bed.That's when I realized he was right. I had to do this, I had to grow. I got on stage the next day and said, ""Hello everyone, I am — what felt like a 15-second pause — T-T-Trev-or Rappleye of FranchiseFilming."" I wonder if people thought I didn't know my name?Nevertheless, I made it through.Related: Find Out Which Brands Have Ranked on the Franchise 500 for Longest, Earning a Spot In our New 'Hall of Fame'700 franchisorsFor my first big speech on stage was at the 2023 International Franchise Professionals Group convention in Florida. I practiced for a solid two weeks — it was like I was back in high school. My whole team knew that I was practicing a 45-minute speech in front of 700 franchisors. I was so well-rehearsed that I slept soundly the night before.


When I was onstage and showing our videos, I saw people were engaged, they were watching and taking notes. After the speech, I was completely humbled to see there was a line of more than 20 franchisors wanting to talk to me.Related: How Immigrating From Argentina to the Bronx at 11 Prepared Her For Life as a FranchiseeThe naysayersOh, the naysayers. They told me I couldn't do it alone, that I was dumb for even trying. And for a minute there, I almost believed them. But I wasn't about to let anyone dictate my success — and neither should you. So I put my head down, devoured every business book I could get my hands on and refused to give up.Being true to myself in every facet of my life paid off, big time. Heck, I even came out as gay when I was 22 and living my truth was the best decision I ever made. And get this — people admire my honesty and courage.Running a seven-figure company once felt like a far-off dream, but in 2022, Franchise Filming hit the elusive million-dollar mark. It wasn't easy, but if you want something bad enough, you'll do whatever it takes. So if you're facing struggles and setbacks, remember my story. Dare to dream big, embrace who you are, and don't let anyone tell you what you can or can't achieve. Because in the end, the only thing that matters is how hard you're willing to fight for what you want.

11,Bantam Bagels' Founder Fell Into a Mindset Trap 'People Don't Talk About' After Selling the Now-Defunct Business for $34 Million — Here's What Happened,"Apr 12, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/what-happened-to-bantam-bagels-founder-reveals-her-struggle/472502,"
In 2013, Elyse Oleksak, co-founder of Bantam Bagels, got a call from her husband Nick about a bite-sized snack that would set some big plans in motion. ""Mini bagels stuffed with cream cheese,"" Oleksak recalls him saying in her recently released memoir A Shark Ate My Bagel: How We Built Bantam Bagels. ""Sort of like doughnut holes, but bagels."" Oleksak had heard plenty of ambitious ideas from her entrepreneurially-minded husband in the past, but tiny stuffed bagels were one she could get behind. The duo met at a grocery store after work to start experimenting.Image Credit: Courtesy of Elyse OleksakIt was the beginning of Bantam Bagels' near-decade-long journey, one that cycled through ""success followed by failure"" and ""elation followed by panic,"" Oleksak tells Entrepreneur exclusively.



The business made a splash on Shark Tank, where the Oleksaks struck a $275,000 deal for 11% equity with Lori Greiner (hence the title of Oleksak's book) in 2014. In the next several years, it saw sales hit $45 million as it expanded the product line to include mini stuffed pancakes and egg bites, landed in 10,000 stores and 8,500 Starbucks and was ultimately acquired by the Ohio-based T. Marzetti Company for $34 million in 2018 before ceasing operations in 2022.Related: All 7 'Shark Tank' Stars Share Tips on How to Become a Millionaire


""We were going to die in the wake of our own success if we didn't do something about it soon.""Like many entrepreneurs who find themselves at the helm of a fast-growing business, the Oleksaks had an ""aha moment"" when they realized their cash-versus-growth dilemma. ""We got to a point where even though this was our baby and it was something that we had owned at near 100% for so long, we were going to die in the wake of our own success if we didn't do something about it soon,"" Oleksak says. So the Oleksaks sold to T. Marzetti. It felt like a perfect match, Oleksak recalls, and the couple stayed on in marketing and product development capacities.However, getting used to her new relationship with the company wasn't easy, Oleksak admits. It's a struggle that didn't make it into the book, she says, but an important one nevertheless. According to Oleksak, with all of the focus on success stories and flashy sales, there's an all-too-common experience that gets lost in the narrative because ""people don't talk about"" it: How do you cope when all of your hard work pays off and your dream finally comes true?""Every single ounce and fiber of our being was dedicated to the survival and growth of this company [for years],"" Oleksak explains, ""so when you operate in this fight or flight mode for so long, it just becomes who you are."" Simultaneously chasing success and steeling for calamity takes a serious mental toll, Oleksak says, and when there were no more fires to put out, her brain began ""inventing disasters"" that didn't exist and therefore had no concrete solutions — a never-ending ""spiral.""


Related: 4 Ways Highly Successful People Handle Tough Times and Get Back on Track""When we were left feeling safe and at peace, I almost didn't know what to do with that safety and peace.""""We found loving arms for our explosive child,"" Oleksak says. ""We did it. But every single sense of self and success [had been] wrapped in this swirl of panic at all times, so when we were left feeling safe and at peace, I almost didn't know what to do with that safety and peace. Your brain almost doesn't know what to do when it stops. I personally went through an extreme breakdown."" Oleksak likens the experience to those of professional athletes who have to redefine themselves after a career in sports.Seeing your biggest dream become a reality can be amazing, but you have to prepare your brain for a complete mindset shift and pick up the appropriate tools to navigate that, according to Oleksak. The entrepreneur is a huge proponent of therapy and credits it with helping her recalibrate what it takes to get from one day to the next without considering chaos a foregone conclusion. ""I worked through a lot to find mental peace and stability and be able to be present again in the moment,"" she says.


Unfortunately, just a couple of years after T. Marzetti acquired Bantam Bagels, the pandemic put pressure on the supply chain, making it a challenge to stock the same variety of products as retailers streamlined processes wherever possible. By that point, Oleksak says she and her husband had given up a lot of decision-making authority and weren't involved in the conversations that ultimately led T. Marzetti to stop production of the brand. Still, Oleksak — and the nearly 1,500 people who signed a petition in support of Bantam Bagels' return — would love to see the products make a comeback one day.Related: 5 Ways to Protect Your Mental HealthAs Oleksak reflected on her entrepreneurial journey ""full of ups and downs,"" she kept coming back to all of the connections she'd made along the way — from every customer who purchased a Bantam Bagel to the manufacturers who took a chance on the product, celebrity endorsers including Oprah, Sarah Jessica Parker and Whoopi Goldberg, and so many more — and wanted to give back with a behind-the-scenes look at lessons learned over the years. So Oleksak put pen to paper and drafted A Shark Ate My Bagel, then opted to self-publish it ""the entrepreneurial way,"" with a marketing plan that included her own website and an Amazon push.""Thank God I organized all those lessons because, man, did I make a lot of mistakes,"" Oleksak laughs. These days, she's approaching the publication of her book as she would the launch of a ""mini business"" and says she's putting most of her energy into that right now. But she also looks forward to working with small businesses in the future, helping them avoid the mistakes she made and secure wins of their own.

12,Feeling Overwhelmed at Work? Follow These Tips to Prevent It From Turning Into Burnout.,"Apr 11, 2024",Cyrus Claffey,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/feeling-overwhelmed-at-work-heres-how-to-handle-it/472314,"
Running a successful business isn't just about finding a lightning-in-a-bottle idea or hiring a great team to surround yourself with; it's also about staying motivated and making sure you don't become too overwhelmed. Keep in mind, however, that acknowledging that you're overwhelmed isn't a sign of weakness but of great self-awareness.It's a skill to step back from a project and say, ""I'm swamped, and I need more help on this project or time away to regroup."" As a business founder and owner at ButterflyMX, I've learned that how you proceed after this acknowledgment is key to not letting your overwhelm turn into burnout.Related: Overwhelmed? These 10 Techniques Can Help You Cope With Uncomfortable Feelings.



Early indications of being overwhelmedIn order to prevent being overwhelmed from morphing into burnout, you have to first be able to detect it. This is hard because many early indications of being overwhelmed are subtle and can be mistaken for typical workplace stress. Still, keeping tabs on the indicators to see if they become persistent over time is a good way to become aware of overwhelm early.Here are a few key indicators that you're becoming overwhelmed at work:


Never-ending feelings of anxiety surrounding projects, meetings and deadlines.Consistently working extended hours that considerably disrupt your work-life balance.Feeling a continual decline in job satisfaction despite achievements.A focus on formerly routine tasks and deadlines as grueling and taxing.You feel like you're facing challenges you can't handle rather than healthily challenging yourself.Overall, when your focus at work shifts from the solutions you're finding to the problems you're facing, you're probably reaching a tipping point. So, it's important to face this issue head-on before it becomes unmanageable.What fuels the state of being overwhelmed?You've determined that you may be overwhelmed, which could very easily turn into burnout at work. What's next? Determining what's fueling your overwhelmed feelings could point you toward a solution.So, what fuels the state of being overwhelmed?


There are a handful of reasons one might become overwhelmed at work. The pressure to grow and climb the corporate ladder, the wish to be a linchpin member of your team or simply the desire to appease your boss and colleagues are all common reasons people become overwhelmed. Noticing that you've felt any or all of these things in conjunction with key indicators of overwhelm may mean that it's time for you to set more professional boundaries.Related: 7 Tips to Avoid Burnout When Growing a BusinessSetting professional boundariesWhen responding to feeling overwhelmed, you don't need to drop all of your responsibilities in order to avoid burnout. Instead, you can reassess your task management style in order to set more firm professional boundaries. When doing this, look at how you prioritize projects, how you delegate tasks and how you and your team members manage your time. You may think that you're doing all of these things well, but until you take a step back and really examine how you manage your tasks, you're unlikely to reduce your frustrations.But what exactly does setting professional boundaries look like? This varies from professional to professional, but most of the time, it starts with the same few things.


First, map out and clearly communicate when projects must be completed, so you and your team are on the same page about deadlines.Second, delegate tasks to your direct reports — and have them delegate to their own teams. Not only does delegating tasks immediately lighten your workload, but it also gives your direct reports the chance to challenge themselves by doing a task outside of their comfort zone. Just be sure to check in on their progress and offer helpful feedback on their work.Third, set professional boundaries to avoid being overwhelmed, which includes project prioritization. Do you have two projects due the same week and don't know which to start with? Consider which project will affect the largest group of people. If one project is a report due that needs to be completed before a larger project can move forward, and your other project is a draft that won't be published for several days or even weeks, start with the report. And if you ever need to push a deadline back in order to prioritize a more pressing project, inform those who will be affected well ahead of time to avoid surprises.Related: 7 Ways to Reduce Stress When You Are Overwhelmed and Need to Prioritize


Recovering from feeling overwhelmedOnce you've faced your feeling of being overwhelmed head-on, you need to apply long-term solutions to ensure that the same lingering threat of burnout doesn't plague your future. But how can you do this?Recognizing areas of imbalance at work is important, but the steps you take to achieve stability are even more important. Keeping a healthy balance of professional challenges, workloads and professional relationships is key to becoming a successful worker long-term.Remember, knowing that you're feeling overwhelmed and taking steps to improve is not an admission of defeat. It's a mark of self-awareness and dedication to the greater good of your company.

        Kerr saw the demand for enamel pins in the artist community and thought the sales could help fund his daughter's 529.
      


        Within a few days of launching his site, he had an order for 1,000 pins from someone he ""had no link to at all.""
      


        Now, Alchemy Merch offers additional products, sees nearly $2 million in annual sales and boasts partnerships with major brands.

Greg Kerr.When did you start your side hustle, and what inspired it? I'd been running a literary-inspired apparel brand, Miles to go, and had begun making enamel pins as one of the products we offered back in 2015. Some friends began asking me for help to get them made because of how confusing overseas production can be. Around that time, my wife and I decided we'd try to have a baby, and on the day we found out we were pregnant (Father's Day in 2016), I bought a domain for Pin Game Strong. I saw there was a demand for help within the artist community, and I initially thought if we could put a few hundred dollars into our daughter's 529, it would be a win. The original intention was that we'd keep running the apparel brand and help people make enamel pins on the side. I quickly recognized that there was a huge gap in the market to offer retail-quality merchandise. Everything was focused on promotional products, and with my background in running a brand, I thought it was important to focus on products people would be proud to bring to market. There was a need to go beyond promotional and into fully custom.

At that point, I had made thousands of pins for myself but hadn't thought about offering it as a service. I offered to help anyone interested and got a quick response. Word of mouth spread, and I saw that people wanted a safe outlet for making pins. Knowing we had a child on the way was the catalyst to buy a domain and throw together some pricing. I was familiar with how promotional products companies price their products and decided I'd try to beat them. Once the site was up, things started happening quickly, and within a few days, I had an order for 1,000 enamel pins from someone I had no link to at all.Image Credit: Alchemy MerchWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As things started moving quickly, I had a lot of struggles with my time and how to balance it with the brand that had been paying my family's bills for the past few years. We went from $0 to $1 million in sales in 18 months, and it was just me. I did all of it: managing the business, handling all orders, communicating with factories and all art. It was a lot to handle. We didn't spend a cent on advertising in the first two years. Word of mouth was spreading and keeping me as busy as I could handle. My first step was to get some help on handling art files so I could keep working on customer interactions. I wish I'd looked for help sooner, but when I finally did get the help, it freed me up to focus on sales more.

How much did the side hustle earn? Within six months, we'd surpassed the monthly revenue of the brand I'd been working on for eight years prior — and it kept growing. Once we saw how quickly it was moving, the secondary goal became to replace my wife's income by the time she'd have to decide whether to go back to work or not after our daughter was born. We hit that goal and kept on running upward.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business, Alchemy Merch. What's been key to that growth, and what does revenue look like now? We hit a point where I needed to let go of the previous business so I could focus all of my time on making products for others. We started as Pin Game Strong and kept on adding new products in: patches, acrylic keychains, washi tape, etc., and the name just felt too limiting. We'd built up solid name recognition but knew it was time to grow beyond pins. Growth has been challenging for the past few years. When Covid hit, we got knocked back twice. First, we had delays in factories returning to work that caused a lot of refunds for events lined up. Then in March, they returned, and the U.S. got hit with lockdowns. A lot of our business is driven by events. Artists sell at fairs, cons and other events, and corporations will [make items] for conferences or team events. Pre-Covid, we were up only, and since then, we've been working hard to really focus on tightening up what we do and how we do it to help stand out. Although we have had growth the past two years, it's not until this year that we are seeing the energy back in people to create again. We have been floating right under $2 million a year in sales for the past two years and are hoping to finally break past it and continue to grow.Related: Don't let your good idea go to waste.

Making not only products, but also full-on retail-ready merchandise can have a lot of obstacles for creators, and our goal is to remove those and help guide them.

As you consider the business's future, what are you most excited about? I'm excited about expanding the types of products we offer and continuing to help creators.

I hope to keep building a company that continues to provide for my family and our employees and keeps helping people.Related: She Used Her Kids' College Fund to Build a Side Hustle, But the Product Was 'Unsellable' — Here's How She Got Back on Track for $100 Million in SalesImage Credit: Alchemy MerchWhat's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Although I didn't actively think about it at the time, Alchemy Merch is a marriage of all of my skill sets and hits on what I really want to be spending my time doing. It's tough running a business in the after-hours if you have a 9-5, but if you really want it, you need to put in the work. If you are thinking about starting a side hustle, really think about what you want to do and if there is a need for it or space in the market for you to improve upon what is out there. The market told me how badly Alchemy Merch was needed, and I responded. When it became clear that this had legs, I never looked back.

More than 80% of American employees said they would potentially quit their job because of a bad manager, according to a survey from software company GoodHire. The idea that ""people quit bosses, not jobs"" isn't new, but as it turns out, direct managers might not be the biggest culprits when it comes to low retention and other workplace issues.According to Heather Walker, senior people scientist at employee experience platform Culture Amp, ""collective trauma from the pandemic"" — which fueled a new distance between employees and leaders that has the former feeling out of ""harmony"" and uncared for — and increasing return-to-office mandates are contributing to a major lack of trust in leadership.Related: 8 Common Mistakes You Might Be Making as a Leader (and How to Fix Them)

      Key Takeaways    



        After moving to New York City, Trejo missed a piece of home: Central Florida's citrus. 
      


        He began his grow-at-home citrus business in 2020 and continues to run it alongside his day job as an insurance agent.
      


        Nowadays, Via Citrus brings in about $36,000 a month — and just acquired new land for additional greenhouses.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Danny Trejo, an insurance agent who started grow-at-home citrus business Via Citrus in 2020.Where did you find the inspiration for your side hustle? I started working on Via Citrus shortly after moving to New York City, inspired by the nostalgia for the citrus groves of Central Florida. I grew up on a large citrus nursery filled with the sights and scents of orange blooms — a vivid part of my childhood that I always cherished.



While I had always wanted to be part of the citrus nursery business, I wanted to contribute in a different way that not only brought value to the business but also meaning to myself. The distance from my roots, coupled with the longing for the familiar fragrance of orange blossoms, sparked the idea to share this piece of my home with others. It was then that I realized I could educate others on how to grow citrus trees — no matter where they were located — by opening an online store.Related: What to Watch - The Most Inspiring Shows for EntrepreneursImage Credit: Courtesy of Via CitrusWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground? What were some challenges? Starting out, I faced the daunting task of setting up an ecommerce platform. With no prior experience in websites, I had to start from scratch, learning the ins and outs of online retail, from design to development.


Simultaneously, I tackled the important step of defining our product line. Given the vast diversity of citrus varieties ranging from oranges, lemons, limes, tangerines and grapefruits, I had to make decisions about which to offer. This involved researching citrus growth habits and the unique selling points of each citrus type to curate a selection that would appeal to a broad audience.Equally important was determining the size of the plants Via Citrus was going to offer. This decision was a delicate balance. On one hand, offering plants that were too small could lead to customer disappointment, as they might not immediately appreciate the beauty or potential of their purchase. On the other hand, larger plants, while more visually appealing and closer to bearing fruit, would incur prohibitive shipping costs, making them less accessible to a wider audience. This required careful consideration of the growth stages of citrus plants, shipping logistics and customer expectations to select sizes that offered the best value for our customers and the business.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?


The first couple of months saw under $1,000 each thanks to family and friends who supported the launch of Via Citrus. However, it wasn't long before we were averaging about $7,000 per month in revenue, with May (Mother's Day) and December (Christmas) being our busiest.What does average monthly revenue look like now? We see $36,000 per month in sales. May and December continue to be our best sales months.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle? It keeps me in touch with my roots — pun intended — by working on this project with my dad. Growing up surrounded citrus, where my dad dedicated over 40 years of his life, has deeply influenced my appreciation for the cultivation and care of citrus. Now as the person behind Via Citrus, I am able to maintain and strengthen this bond despite being six hours away from the farm. Via Citrus serves as a vital link to my father and the work he continues to do. He's not just the grower — he's out there selecting and packaging each citrus plant we send out to our customers. This hands-on approach from him ensures that every plant we deliver carries a piece of our family's dedication and love for citrus cultivation.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Via CitrusAs you consider the business's future, what are you most excited about? The booming plant industry and the significant steps we are taking to grow alongside it get me excited. As our world gets more digital, people are turning to gardening and indoor plants for both hobby and home decor to take a break from their screens. This trend presents a promising opportunity for Via Citrus, as our unique offering of citrus plants aligns with this growing interest.What is particularly thrilling is our recent purchase of new land for the development of additional greenhouses. These new greenhouses will have the capacity to increase our variety of citrus offers, improve our cultivation process and ensure we can meet the growing demand from our customers.

For me, I wanted to get everything right the first time: the perfect-looking website, the perfect variety, size, packaging, images, etc. I was spending too much time perfecting. Perfection is somewhat of a double-edged sword. No one was seeing my website or buying my citrus plants. Therefore, my quest for perfection limited my ability to get any consumer feedback to make anything better. Eventually, after years of planning and perfecting, I launched the website. The few customers who did engage became invaluable sources of feedback. Their insights helped us refine our offers in ways I hadn't anticipated.It's important to get your product out there, even if it's a limited run of your product. Early feedback provides incredible insights and can steer your side hustle in a direction that better meets market needs and preferences.

Dr. Gladys McGarey is 103 years old and started medical school in September 1941, months before the U.S. entered World War II. ""It was kind of an interesting process throughout the whole world, where women were just beginning to step into various fields, and medicine was one of them,"" McGarey tells Entrepreneur. As the daughter of two medical missionaries in India who'd learned from them how to treat patients, many of whom were then deemed ""untouchables"" according to the country's rigid caste system, she'd long known that medicine was her calling.Image Credit: Courtesy of Dr. Gladys McGareyBut as one of few women to attend medical school in the U.S. at the time, she had to contend with unique challenges and dismissive attitudes over the course of her medical career. ""The concept was that it's going to be tougher for you out in the world than for the guys, so you have to be smarter and more this and more of that and the other thing,"" McGarey recalls of her experience at the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania. ""So they really pushed us.""



During the program, when McGarey asked questions about holistic medical practices — an approach to healthcare that takes a person's mind, body and spirit into consideration and an area she'd help bring to the mainstream in the U.S. — the dean told her ""they were not appropriate."" On several occasions, the dean even sent her to see a psychiatrist, who maintained that she was completely fine. But McGarey wasn't deterred. Not even when she started her internship at Deaconess Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio and found that ""there had never been another woman, and so they didn't know what to do with me.""Related: The Shocking Ways Data Bias Makes Women 'Irrelevant,' and What We Can Do to Stop It


""The men had their rooms and facilities, but there weren't any there for me,"" McGarey explains. ""So I got an x-ray table, a pillow and a blanket. But I was grateful for that. I didn't think I was being abused because I knew why — it was that they didn't have anything."" But the head surgical resident went out of his way to make McGarey's experience difficult, she says, resulting in an ""ongoing push and pull"" where he'd sign her up for the longest surgeries and did everything he could to make her drop out, which only made her more determined to succeed.""I can't tell you how many times I went to make a house call, and they'd tell me to leave.""And McGarey did, ultimately going on to open her medical practice with her then husband Dr. Bill McGarey in Wellsville, Ohio in an era before women could open their own bank accounts. There had never been a woman doctor there before, she says, so it took a while to build trust with the community. ""I can't tell you how many times I went to make a house call, and they'd tell me to leave, and I'd have to call Bill and have him come and pick up where I had left off."" After a couple of years, however, she did gain acceptance, and eventually was the only doctor making house calls in the area.Over the decades, McGarey raised six children while continuing to make her mark on holistic medicine. In 1973, she held the first symposium on acupuncture in the U.S. at Stanford University; in 1978, she co-founded the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA). Today, the still-consulting centenarian is the author of six books, including her most recent The Well-Lived Life: A 102-Year-Old Doctor's Six Secrets to Health and Happiness at Every Age.

Here are her six secrets to a healthy, happy life:Secret I: You are here for a reason — and have to find your ""juice""""The juice is our reason for living. It's our fulfillment, our joy,"" McGarey writes. ""It's what happens when life is activated by love. It's the energy we get from the things that matter and mean something to us."" She adds that it's what her parents obtained from working with underserved populations. ""Each of us is here to connect with our unique gifts; this is what activates our desire to be alive. Achieving this connection isn't necessarily the point. The search counts for far more.""


McGarey shares some additional words of wisdom for women who hope to follow their purpose into traditionally male-dominated fields.""Figure out what it is that you want and go for it — because it's not going to happen unless you do,"" she tells Entrepreneur. ""And anyway, a profession is your own personal thing. Everybody doesn't do their own profession the way you do."" She notes that if you can accept that your profession is part of who you are and the reason why you're here, life becomes easier. ""It becomes so interesting,"" she says.Related: Make Money Doing What You Love — 10 Key Tips on Monetizing Your PassionSecret II: All life needs to move""We seem to have a deep unconscious knowing that life is supposed to move,"" McGarey writes. ""This is what makes it so obvious when things are not moving — even if we don't know what to do about it…Life itself is always in movement, so aligning our life force means that we must always look for the flow within us.""


McGarey uses the metaphor of someone carrying a heavy bag to explain how to get ""unstuck."" ""I can hardly move because this bag is so heavy, and I keep looking at it,"" she says. ""If I look at it too long, my neck's going to get stiff and then I can't move. But if I begin to move and look for the light and turn myself around, the light is always there."" It's not a matter of the light going away, she adds, noting that for her the light represents understanding and healing. ""Light is always there. It depends on whether we look for it or not,"" she says.Related: 4 Tips Every Entrepreneur Can Use to Get UnstuckSecret III: Love is the most powerful medicine""Love truly is the greatest medicine the world has ever known,"" McGarey writes. ""It takes life from a passive state (being alive) to an active state (truly living)...Our life force is activated by love. Love has the uncommon ability to transform everything it touches. It transforms labor from drudgery to bliss. It transforms laughter from cruelty to joy.""McGarey tells Entrepreneur that although her other five books delve into the practice of medicine, the essence of why she was in the field and the very core of what medicine is was missing. ""This book is about what true healing is all about — and true healing is about love,"" she explains.

""We are happiest and healthiest when we are contributing to and drawing from our collective life force…Connecting with community amplifies our individual life force by realigning it with the collective life force.""And the power of connecting with a community that understands you shouldn't be underestimated, according to McGarey. As a child, she had to repeat first grade twice because she was dyslexic, though she didn't know it at the time and spent her early school years ""thinking I was stupid, an idea that was promoted by my first-grade teacher,"" she writes.""It's awfully easy to get discouraged and think that you're not able to complete the things that you want to do if you totally are surrounded by people who don't understand you,"" she tells Entrepreneur, noting that it's critical to look for ways to help people who are struggling with being stuck. ""We're all in this together,"" she adds.

""Everything in life becomes a teacher. Seeing everything this way helps us make our life a living, breathing process.""One of McGarey's earliest life lessons came when she was performing in a third-grade school play. McGarey had the role of a frog meant to jump across a pond; dressed in a frog suit her mother had dyed green, she made the leap — and came up short, falling into the water to uproarious laughter. When her brothers, who'd witnessed the humiliation, began to joke about it at dinner later that night, McGarey's mother used it as a teaching moment.""My mother says to them, 'All right, boys, now you've had your fun,'"" McGarey recalls. ""'What can we as a family do that will help Glady if this ever happens to her again, to get through it and have people laughing with her and not at her?'"" She explains that her mother showed her how we can help each other as we see somebody who is struggling in their life. ""If we could just reach out a little bit of hope for them so that it can help them deal with it, we've done a huge job,"" she says.

      Key Takeaways    



        Narcissism isn't inherently pathological for an individual or other people, Lundquist says. 
      


        Disordered narcissism impairs how people operate in the world and is highly damaging to relationships. 
      


        A healthy sense of narcissism can come with major advantages, especially in the workplace. 
      



""Narcissism refers to the sense we all have of ourselves — the regard we hold ourselves in, the ways that we focus — and sometimes fixate — on ourselves,"" Matt Lundquist, a Columbia University-trained psychotherapist and founder and clinical director of TriBeCa Therapy, tells Entrepreneur.Narcissism isn't inherently pathological for an individual or other people, Lundquist says, but the term is so frequently used ""as a pejorative"" that the idea that narcissism can be normal, healthy — and even underdeveloped in some instances — falls by the wayside. One need look no further than so-called ""#NarcTok,"" where people use the diagnosis ""as a stand-in for all manner of unpleasant behaviors and character traits.""In reality, classifying someone as a ""narcissist"" in a clinical psychopathology context implies ""they have an impairment in narcissism that is severe enough to cause problems in how they're operating in the world,"" Lundquist explains. They may have narcissistic traits or what is termed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a Narcissistic Personality Disorder, he adds.

This Q&A features Lauren Myrick, founder and CEO of Found. Myrick raised more than $75.2 million from leading VCs including Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund and Lightspeed Venture Partners to build a better banking system for self-employed freelancers and independent workers. Image credit: Courtesy of FoundWhat inspired the idea for Found?I've seen the frustrations of small business owners firsthand through my personal and professional life. On a personal note, my sister is a yoga studio owner and self-employed fitness instructor, and I saw her struggles navigating traditional finance and business management tools. Professionally, when I was the GM of Square's Payroll business, I saw how complicated, painful and stressful taxes can be for small business owners.



Both of these perspectives inspired me to further investigate the financial management and tooling challenges that self-employed business owners face. Connor Dunn, my co-founder, and I started talking to family members, friends and other self-employed business owners to understand their challenges. Many people don't realize that managing your finances when you're self-employed differs quite a bit from when you are a W-2 employee. There are different tax requirements and forms, and you are on your own to figure out how much you need to pay in taxes. We also saw a common theme that people start their own businesses because they want freedom, flexibility and creative control — not so they can become their own accountants.Related: I've Had a Secret Side Hustle for Decades. It Keeps Tens of Thousands of Dollars in My Pocket — and Gets Me Into Places I Wouldn't Go Otherwise.


During these conversations and additional research, we realized two important things. First, we could provide tremendous value to these self-employed individuals by giving them a toolkit to manage their finances — something we felt we were uniquely equipped to do because of our backgrounds at Square. Second, the self-employed population in America is large and growing: Approximately 60 million Americans today are self-employed, and self-employment will soon surpass traditional employment to become the majority of the American workforce. Shortly after these conversations, we started Found.Why is doing taxes one of the most difficult financial tasks for freelancers?Unlike W-2 employees, business owners and freelancers do not proactively have income taxes taken out of their paychecks — and are expected to calculate and report their expected taxes themselves throughout the year. They are also frequently acting as their own ""finance department,"" an area where most have very little expertise. This typically involves keeping business and personal finances separate, correctly calculating and proactively saving the proper amount for taxes, and tracking financial deadlines, expenses and fines.In addition, tax laws are always changing and complicated by both state and federal policies. These laws are also starting to regulate how payments are invoiced, paid and tracked in relation to apps and platforms that we all interact with. For example, millions of freelancers, gig workers, solopreneurs and contract workers breathed a collective sigh of relief in December 2022 when the IRS delayed the new tax-reporting requirement for third-party payment platforms like Venmo, Cash App and PayPal, but that was just a temporary measure.Keeping finances organized while also staying on top of these changing laws is a lot to manage, and the tools available to the self-employed are typically expensive and disparate. Because of this, and because there is the ever-looming risk of owing money in taxes at the end of the year, we frequently hear that doing taxes is one of the most stressful parts of being self-employed.

Found can automatically estimate and set aside money for taxes for our users based on their income. We can also help our users easily categorize expenses and provide guidance on what can and cannot be deducted as write-offs.Found partnered with Column Tax to take these benefits a step further and provide tax filing services to its users, particularly those who are Schedule C filers. Column's tech is integrated into Found's suite of financial tools for independent workers. With Column Tax, Found Plus subscribers can access free tax filing services as part of their annual subscription.Filing through Column Tax is already around 1.5-2 times faster than standard DIY tax software providers and can be even faster for certain filers like independent workers who often have more complex tax returns. Because Column Tax is able to pull data directly from Found accounts, this partnership can help save Found users a lot of time when entering financial details during the filing process. The IRS has estimated that self-employed individuals spend 24 hours on taxes per year! And pay $560.


Related: She Used Her Kids' College Fund to Build a Side Hustle, But the Product Was 'Unsellable' — Here's How She Got Back on Track for $100 Million in SalesDo you have any top tips for freelancing and side-hustling filers who want to file with ease?First, it's incredibly important to organize your income sources. Keep track of 1099-NEC forms from clients and 1099-K forms from payment processors like PayPal to avoid a last-minute scramble. Second, make sure to separate business and personal finances, ideally through maintaining separate bank accounts, which will help simplify end of year reporting. You also want to meticulously track all business-related expenses, as these could be deductible expenses and significantly lower your taxable income. This could include expenses related to equipment, supplies, home office costs, phone bills and any other materials needed for your business.Lastly, it's crucial to understand your responsibility for paying self-employment tax in addition to regular income tax. To ensure you have sufficient funds to cover your tax bill, including estimated tax payments, allocate 20-30% of your freelance income into a separate savings account dedicated solely to taxes. If you expect to owe at least $1,000 in federal taxes for the year, make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid underpayment penalties. Properly budgeting and making timely tax payments can save you from potential financial headaches down the line.And what are some of the common mistakes they make during filing, especially around retirement?When we surveyed Found customers last year, we learned that only 22% of self-employed people know how to maximize potential deductions and write-offs, which means they are missing the chance to lower their taxable income — and therefore their tax bill. Some of the tax deductions, like when you buy a new laptop for your job or pay your CPA, are more straightforward, but there are so many others.

And when you're self-employed, you can likely deduct contributions made to several types of retirement plans, such as traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs and Solo 401(k)s. Some of these retirement accounts can lower taxable income by deferring the tax bill until the money is withdrawn in retirement. Not being aware of these benefits can lead to missed opportunities for tax savings.

    When Cliff Smith lost his job, he picked up an under-the-radar gig that would make it possible to keep dining out — something he and his wife love to do.

      Key Takeaways    



        Smith and his wife first heard about the EyeSpy side hustle from friends who knew founder Mistie Boulton. 
      


        Smith started with the company over two decades ago; these days, he completes about three evaluations each month. 
      


        Since he began keeping track in 2008, Smith has enjoyed a $40,000 food budget in exchange for his reviews. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cliff Smith. Smith is based in Palo Alto, California and has been an evaluator for EyeSpy Critiquing & Consulting since 2003. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. I started working as a mystery diner with EyeSpy over 20 years ago. Our friends knew the founder Mistie Boulton, so they were among the very first people to do it, and when they told us about it, we thought it sounded too good to be true — to have our meals at nice restaurants paid for in exchange for writing up the experience. We didn't jump on the opportunity right away, but when I lost my job and began to tutor GMAT prep, I picked up the side hustle so we could continue dining out.Typically, I complete around three evaluations a month, and the work takes me to fine dining establishments as well as more casual restaurants; sometimes, the evaluation will even be for a takeout order. One Saturday last month, my wife and I did a brunch evaluation at The Village Pub, and our budget for brunch was $250 — and we needed it. We actually went slightly over with the tax and tip. The following Friday, we got a pizza delivery. So it remains a mix, and that's one of the advantages: This side hustle gets you into places you might not go otherwise.



Related: She Used Her Kids' College Fund to Build a Side Hustle, But the Product Was 'Unsellable' — Here's How She Got Back on Track for $100 Million in SalesThe process usually starts when you receive an email, then you go to the website and see that you have an assignment. You can negotiate when to do the assignment within the month, and if you can't do it that month, you can explain why and potentially take on the assignment the next month, but you may not get it again. It depends on what's going on — sometimes if they already have someone for the following week, it doesn't work out.


For each evaluation, there's an online survey form, and they do differ. Different restaurants care about different things. For example, The Village Pub cares a lot about how they handle the wine. Do they observe proper protocol? Do they keep filling your glass? Other places don't care nearly as much about that, but they might care about how many people say goodbye to you. So before an evaluation, you really do need to look at the form. Even if it's a similar kind of restaurant, the management may care about different things for different reasons. And you're supposed to remember when they did different things. I take pictures so I have a timestamp for all of it.Related: This 29-Year-Old Left His Marketing Job to Pursue a Side Hustle — Now He Earns Nearly $200,000 a Year: 'So Attracted to the Adrenaline Rush'You have to turn in the evaluation within 24 hours. When we started, it was two days, but they changed it to the next day. And in a way, that's reasonable because you have to remember a lot, and it does fade. The time it takes to finish an evaluation depends on the place. For the pizza place I mentioned, I completed it that night and maybe spent two hours on it at most. But I probably spent about six hours on The Village Pub evaluation. I wouldn't do it all in one day for a place like that.We also have to submit photos. I use Photoshop to crop them because I'm surreptitiously taking the pictures — though it doesn't have to be too surreptitious because a lot of people are taking pictures these days — but I take so many that I don't want to be too obvious about it. I don't take great pictures all the time. For the food, I do, but for the other things, not so much. But I may take a picture of the table to show the place settings if they care about their positioning. Later, when I'm submitting the photos, I need to crop them so they look better, and I reduce the rest so I don't bring the EyeSpy server to its knees.


Since July 2008, I've tracked how much I was budgeted for each evaluation — and it comes out to $40,000 in total. Of course, the real number is higher than that because we started the side hustle in 2003. And, of course, the cost of dining out has increased over the years. My favorite part of being a mystery diner is the ability to go places we wouldn't otherwise; it gets us into restaurants like The Village Pub, where we just wouldn't spend that kind of money on a dinner, let alone a brunch. We also try places we might not normally try. We go to Oren's Hummus, which is owned by the founder Mistie Boulton, all the time, but before working with EyeSpy, I'm not sure if we'd ever had Middle Eastern food.Related: I Started a Semi-Passive Side Hustle That Earns $33,000 a Week on Amazon: 'Selling There Is a No-Brainer'I also appreciate that I really have a voice. Generally, if you go to a restaurant and they treat you badly, you might ask to speak to the manager, and maybe you get comped or you get a free dessert. But I have a nuclear weapon. If I note that something isn't right, there probably will be a change. This wasn't vindictive, but one time, we went to a nice bistro in San Francisco, and our server just wasn't very accomplished. It wasn't a deal-breaker that would keep us out of that restaurant in the future or anything like that, but things weren't smooth or well done. A few months later, we went back to the same restaurant, and that same server was there, but now she was an assistant server, not the main server. So I thought, Well, they listened. And she seemed to be okay doing that; it was a better fit for her skill set. It's gratifying to know that I'll be heard because the restaurant management paid to hear it.

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2008, Vaccarella needed a better, practical beach bag — so she decided to create one herself. 
      


        The bags flew off shelves at a local boutique, but disaster struck after she invested her kids' college savings in more pieces.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Kim Vaccarella, founder of Bogg Bag, which offers a ""lightweight, durable, washable collection"" of bags and is on track to see $100 million in revenue this year, per the company. Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag. Kim Vaccarella. Did you have a 9-5 when you started the business? Yes, I spent 26 years in commercial real estate before fully dedicating myself to Bogg in 2018.



When did you start the business, and where did you find the inspiration for it?It seems like a lifetime ago. The idea came to me in 2008, born out of a practical need for a better beach bag. I envisioned the ultimate mom bag: durable and sturdy, with non-collapsing sides, large enough to carry everything we needed and washable at the end of the day. The catalyst was a trip to the Jersey Shore and a serendipitous encounter with EVA material, which I realized was the perfect material for crafting the perfect beach bag.Related: The Remote Side Hustle a 43-Year-Old Musician Works on for 1 Hour a Day Earns Nearly $3,000 a Month: 'All From the Comfort of Home'


What were some of the first steps you took to get Bogg Bag off the ground? How did you come up with the ""Bogg Bag"" name?As a full-time working mom with no experience in bag sales, the leap into launching Bogg Bag was huge. The idea came to me as a necessity, and despite the challenge of stepping into unfamiliar territory, I was determined to give it a go.The goal initially was to patent the Bogg Bag concept and sell the idea, avoiding the complexities of manufacturing. After facing numerous rejections, I realized the only way to see my vision come to life was to do it myself.Naming the bag was simpler than you'd think. Reflecting on water, frogs and lily pads, I played around with words until Bogg stuck. It felt right, signaling a fresh start — Bogg, it's the new bag!You used your kids' college fund to bring the dream to life. What happened next?After our first batch hit a small local boutique, they flew off the shelves. At first, I wondered if it was just friends and family showing support, but I chose to believe it was genuine love for the product. Encouraged, I doubled down and ordered 600 more. Those sold out too. Feeling bold, I invested my kids' college savings into over 1,000 pieces. It was a major moment, unloading a full container in our storage unit's parking lot under the night sky. But as we unpacked, my heart sank — every piece was marred by black streaks, unsellable to the high standards I dreamt of for Bogg.

We found a new purpose for these imperfect bags. The storm had wreaked havoc on our community, so we repurposed the flawed bags as emergency kits filled with essentials for those affected by the storm, distributing them to families in need. It was a heartrending experience, but providing aid gave a new meaning to our efforts.Initially, I thought this marked the end of Bogg's journey. However, about a year later, our Facebook page lit up with messages from those recipients. Beyond their thanks, they wanted more bags — for themselves, for family, as gifts. That overwhelming response reignited my resolve. I knew then that Bogg had to make a comeback.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bogg Bag


What were some of the additional challenges you faced while building your business, and how did you navigate them?After leaving my steady job in 2018, the pressure of succeeding on my own was immense. Having been accustomed to a regular income for 26 years, the shift was daunting. I set an ambitious target: $1 million in sales for 2018. Miraculously, we hit it. Then 2019 began promisingly until Covid brought the world to a standstill. Like everyone, we were in uncharted territory with no playbook on how to adapt.While many brands shifted to online sales — a logical move in such uncertain times — we chose a path less traveled. We stayed in close touch with our retail partners, sharing in their hardships and looking for ways to support them. The Bogg Bag's unique selling point — its washability — unexpectedly became its strength during the pandemic. Hospitals purchased them for healthcare workers, schools for teachers, and stores filled them with goods for contactless pickups and deliveries as Easter approached.This approach may not have been the most profitable in the short term, but it was the right thing to do. Maintaining these relationships was more important than immediate gains. To this day, I'm grateful for the support we were able to provide during those tough times, a sentiment echoed by our partners whenever we meet at trade shows.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? What does total revenue look like now?Even in the early days of 2014 and 2015, we began seeing monthly revenue come in, albeit modest, but steady and growing. Fast forward to 2023: We hit a milestone that once seemed a distant dream, crossing over $50 million in revenue. Now, with momentum on our side, we're ambitiously setting our sights even higher, targeting a groundbreaking $100 million in 2024. This growth is a clear testament not only to our product's value but also to the incredible team behind Bogg and the unwavering support from our community. We truly have something special.

24,"This Entrepreneur Pranked Mark Cuban on National Television. The Shark Was So Impressed He Offered to Invest $640,000 — in Empty Boxes.","Apr 1, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/this-prank-on-mark-cuban-led-to-a-640000-offer-for-prank-o/471719,"
Ryan Walther, co-founder of prank gift box and gag gift company Prank-O, has had a passion for comedy from a young age. ""It goes back to when I was in third grade, and I saw David Letterman do Velcro Man,"" he tells Entrepreneur. ""Right then, I said, 'I want to do that.'"" Walther didn't ""become the next king of late night,"" but he did work at the satirical news outlet The Onion for more than 20 years.It was there that Walther met his co-founder Arik Nordby. Nordby would bring fake gift boxes to The Onion store, which always sold out fast. Walther saw potential in the product, and when a little bit of research revealed the plethora of gift-giving occasions in the U.S. — and that no company was the go-to brand for comedic gifting — the wheels continued to turn.Image Credit: Courtesy of Prank-O. Arik Nordby, left; Ryan Walther, right. 



""I felt that gifting had become obligatory and mundane,"" Walther says. ""Aren't parties supposed to be full of laughter? So at that moment, I sought to develop a brand that brought great comedy to gifting occasions and parties.""Related: 'Don't Follow Your Passion': Mark Cuban Shares the 'Worst Piece' of Business Advice He's Ever Received — And How Changing That Mindset Can Lead to Success


""[With] everything that we do, we want to make sure people are laughing.""Walther and Nordby launched Prank-O — ""a 21st-century gift company that delivers laughter and experience"" — in July 2013. The first set of boxes included the Crib Dribbler, ""kind of like a gerbil feeder [for] a crib""; the Wake & Bake Dream Griddle Alarm Clock; the Family Blankeez that covers up to eight people and even an SUV; and the Sizzl Bacon Scented Dryer Sheets.""[With] everything that we do, we want to make sure people are laughing,"" Walther says. Essentially, Prank-O gives consumers ""the keys to the car,"" he adds: Whoever shows up to the party with one of the comedic boxes in tow ""[is] going to be the hero, where they deliver the prank pack, and the whole room erupts with laughter and passes it around, and it's a ton of fun.""One of the business's earliest hurdles was explaining to potential retailers that there wasn't actually a product in the box. But once they were in on the joke, the ""light bulb"" went off — and ""they absolutely loved it,"" Walther says. Prank-O landed Urban Outfitters as its first account during the 2013 holiday season; Target, Kohl's, Walmart and numerous others followed.

Walther initially shot the idea down, much to his co-founder's — and the producer's — surprise. When the producer called back to ask why he'd declined, Walther said he ""wasn't interested in selling the company in seven minutes."" The producer explained that there's a due diligence period wherein either party can back out of a deal without penalty, and Walther was on board, as long as Prank-O was able to stay ""on brand"" — and prank the Sharks.The producers loved the idea. ""We came up with a skit where our company was RynArik Technologies, technology solutions for tomorrow, today,"" Walther recalls. ""So we came out in our RynArik uniforms and presented different prank packs that were positioned as RynArik products. I was wearing a prank pack we brought to life: a magnetic plate that stuck to your head so your kids could eat a meal while they sat on your shoulders.""


Image Credit: Courtesy of Prank-O. Ryan Walther, left; Arik Nordby, right.The Sharks ""were confused,"" Walther says — then ""certainly became amused."" When the duo revealed themselves as the co-founders of Prank-O, the company behind empty gift boxes, Mark Cuban was impressed. Prank-O had done $10 million in sales since 2013 and was on track for nearly $3 million in 2018. Although Walther and Nordby initially asked for $640,000 for an 8% stake, Cuban negotiated $640,000 for a 25% stake. The deal didn't close after the due diligence period.Related: Humor Can Make You (and Your Employees) More Influential — If You Do It Right""The studio is underwater — nobody can really know that — with sharks circling above you,"" Walther quips. ""That kind of makes it a little more intense.""


""I'm an empty box baron. Not many people in this world sell empty boxes.""The Onion is a social commentary on news, and Prank-O is a social commentary on consumers, Walther says. To stay current and relevant, Prank-O is constantly innovating to keep up with ""the ever-changing times of products and technology."" It's about layering ""fresh"" parody on what's new in the marketplace, he adds.Image Credit: Courtesy of Prank-OThese days, Prank-O boasts a nearly six-figure email list with an open rate that can reach 60%. Still, marketing and distribution remain two of the company's most significant challenges. Many people simply aren't aware of the product, Walther says, and distribution in the gift space can be tough with Hallmark's and American Greetings' hold on the market. Selling through Amazon in addition to brick-and-mortar stores has been helpful, he notes.


Looking ahead, Prank-O has plans to ""bring the Prank-O-verse and its characters and inventors"" to life with a not yet disclosed media project, and next year, the company will launch Prank-O Labs, ""which will essentially bring brands to life on and around April Fool's Day"" — ""a great day to spread laughter.""Related: 5 Corny Jokes Will Get You Past Cold-Calling Gatekeepers""I'm an empty box baron,"" Walther says. ""Not many people in this world sell empty boxes.

So overall awareness certainly grows year over year.""

      Key Takeaways    



        Would you answer a late-night text message from a recruiter after a job interview?
      


        The message is a test to help determine whether someone is a good fit for a job or a culture.
      


        William Vanderbloemen said that not texting back isn't a dealbreaker, but a fast reply is a plus.

Responding quickly to a text message could help you land a job.


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. You go to a job interview at 1 p.m.At about 10 p.m., you get this text: ""Hey, Tim. This is Ben. I work at Vanderbloemen. I was out of the office today. I heard you were there. Heard that everyone was really impressed with you. I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you. I would love to connect with you sometime. Hope that can work.""



Do you reply? If so, how long does it take you?Your decision might affect whether you're hired.


The test's creator and occasional proctor is William Vanderbloemen. He runs an executive-search firm in Houston. Vanderbloemen's company uses the text-message test after job interviews for certain roles at his own hard-charging firm or for jobs where clients expect workers to be super responsive.Texting back quickly might up your chance of snagging the job, at least at Vanderbloemen's 45-person firm.Sounds simple enough. But the text is also a reminder of the always-on pressure that's pushed some workers to ditch hustle culture. Trial by text message joins other offbeat quizzes meant to help determine whether a job candidate should get an offer letter. There's the spouse interview over dinner. And there's the coffee-cup test: A hiring manager shows those who come for interviews where the kitchen is, offers them a coffee, and then rejects those who don't bus their dishes afterward.The text-message test is also a reminder of how it can be difficult to land a job even as the overall US unemployment rate is low and many industries are hard up for workers. But in areas like tech, where many big employers have trimmed jobs in the past couple of years, some workers are left sending out huge numbers of résumés. And when job seekers do get a bite, interviews can drag on for round after round.Vanderbloemen is quick to note that how you respond — or don't — to an after-hours text from someone saying they're with his firm won't keep you from getting a job. And he said that even responding within 24 hours would put most candidates far ahead of their competition. ""We're just terrible as humans at responding,"" he said.


But text back within the one-minute response time his sales and marketing teams operate by? ""Then we're like, 'Yeah, no, he might be the same kind of crazy that we are,'"" Vanderbloemen said. ""Is that normal for every job? No. Would it work for every company? No.""The test came about after Vanderbloemen hired some people who seemed promising but then didn't deliver on the company's fast turnaround time for clients, which he said is essential for some roles. That led Vanderbloemen to determine he had to measure for speed — before making a hire — for jobs in areas like sales and marketing.So about a decade ago, Vanderbloemen asked one of the people on his team to text someone who'd been great in an interview. The colleague sent the text at about 10:30 p.m., and the candidate responded right away. Bingo.William Vanderbloemen. Courtesy Vanderbloemen Search Group via BIVanderbloemen, the founder and CEO of Vanderbloemen Search Group, decided the text-message test could be a good measure of whether a candidate would mesh well with a client with a move-fast culture. He compared it to pulling off a successful organ transplant by finding tissue that matches. ""Oh, you do things the way they do,"" he said. ""Doesn't make it normal. Doesn't make it right. But you guys match each other.""Switching the interview locationVanderbloemen doesn't rely just on the text-message test. One time, in New York City, he got turned around and realized he didn't have time to make it to the coffee shop where he'd planned to meet a job candidate. So he contacted the man and asked whether they could meet somewhere else. The man responded: ""No, I don't mind. I like change.""Vanderbloemen was impressed. Now he'll sometimes change the location of an interview 30 minutes before it's set to take place to see how a candidate responds.


He said it's not something he does all the time. Some jobs don't require that kind of flexibility or speed. Even with the text message, he said, it's often someone at his firm, not him, who might send it. As the boss, he realizes it's more intimidating if it comes from him. ""It's not fair because I'm the guy with the name on the door, and now I am being kind of just abusive,"" he said.Setting up some rulesVanderbloemen, who has a degree in religion and philosophy, said his company has guidelines meant to protect its workers from needing to be on at all hours. After-hours emails should get a response within 24 hours, he said. Evening Slack messages are rare but should get a response that night ""because that's like Defcon 3,"" he said. ""Defcon 2 would be if I text you after hours, I need an answer like now,"" he added. ""And if I call you after hours, pick up.""He said the firm enforced the rules. It meant he and some colleagues had to quit a group text about ""Game of Thrones"" on Sunday nights.Vanderbloemen said the text-message test still has its place in a world where some workers are trying to avoid being on call all the time.""For our company, particularly certain teams within our company, it's a direct indicator to us of whether you are dysfunctional like us,"" he quipped.

26,3 Ways to Nurture the Entrepreneurial Spirit in Your Children,"Mar 29, 2024",Mary Banks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-nurture-the-entrepreneurial-spirit-in-your-children/471572,"
The entrepreneurial landscape is changing with the youth embracing entrepreneurship over traditional career paths. It's becoming clear that Gen Z and the generations to follow are drawn to the idea of being their own bosses. It's an exciting shift that gives parents the unique opportunity to nurture and support the entrepreneurial spirit in their children. After all, entrepreneurial spirits embody heightened creativity, visionary thinking and excellent problem-solving — qualities every parent hopes to instill in their child. Here's how you can cultivate entrepreneurship in your child:1. Nurture their creativityCreativity is one of the pillars of entrepreneurship. The hard part is that creativity isn't something you can force; it's something you can inspire. To do so, you must give children ample creative opportunities. These don't have to break the bank or be overly complex. It can be as simple as taking trips to the library, choosing different books each time and having discussions about them. You can talk about books' stories, characters and themes and ask your child to write alternate endings. You can also provide them with art supplies to draw, paint, or sculpt, allowing them to experiment with different materials and techniques to express themselves freely.Part of sparking their creativity is also giving children age-appropriate opportunities to problem-solve, whether it be through extracurriculars, fun escape rooms, puzzle-board games, competitions or real-life planning, such as for family trips. Ultimately, you should create an environment where creativity, experimentation and expression are welcomed and celebrated. Doing so will help them learn to think outside the box, take risks and see possibilities where others may see roadblocks.



Related: How Your Entrepreneurial Spirit Can Lead The Way in Crisis2. Normalize failureAs parents, we want to see our children succeed in everything they do. However, failure is an inevitable part of everyone's life, and shielding our children from it will only give them unrealistic expectations. Normalizing failure as an inherent part of the learning process is imperative. It's a challenging concept that we must first embrace ourselves. By encouraging children to perceive setbacks as stepping stones to success rather than obstacles, we can help them develop the tenacity to bounce back stronger and propel themselves toward any endeavor they pursue.


Related: How to Use Your Entrepreneurial Spirit to Ignite the World3. Encourage early business ventures and mentorshipYour child doesn't have to wait for a distant MBA program or ample business opportunity to dip their toes into entrepreneurship. Remember those classic lemonade stands we all started with? Well, they're more than just a childhood memory — they're proof that the entrepreneurial spirit runs deep in us, even as kids. Take my son, for instance. When he found out we had no more space for his toys, he took matters into his own hands. He set up a makeshift shop near our apartment in New York City, laid out his toys on a blanket, and sold one to a passerby!So, we must shift away from the idea that entrepreneurship is only for adults with fancy degrees or massive investments. It all starts with those little bouts of creativity and ideas that turn into action. Encouraging our kids to be independent thinkers, make decisions independently and take on small passion projects can go a long way. But we can also take it one step further by tapping into all of the kid-friendly entrepreneurial resources at our fingertips, including programs, conferences, competitions and workshops. There are even camps designed specifically to teach kids as young as four how to brainstorm ideas, set goals and market their creations. These opportunities allow your child to learn from successful entrepreneurs, understand the hardships and triumphs of this path and begin making small advances towards it early on.Final thoughtsIn the ever-evolving world of entrepreneurship, innovation knows no age limits. As parents, we play a vital role in fostering an entrepreneurial mindset in our children. Whether they choose to become future leaders or not, doing so will equip them with self-reliance, creativity, problem-solving and confidence — invaluable skills that will undoubtedly help them achieve success in any field.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features 29-year-old Jason Nelson, who turned his wedding entertainment side hustle into full-time business The Essential Jason Nelson. Image Credit: Michael Romeo CreationsWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?When I started playing the saxophone and piano for weddings, private events and nightlife in 2019, I worked as an email marketing coordinator for a retail company in the New Jersey suburbs. I've always been extremely passionate about chasing happiness over money, so becoming an entrepreneur happened by coincidence when I discovered a way to combine my love for entertaining others with my love for mainstream party music.



Related: I Started a Semi-Passive Side Hustle That Earns $33,000 a Week on Amazon: 'Selling There Is a No-BrainerHappiness for me is the ability to wake up every day to do what I love and know that my work makes a difference in the lives of others. After all, being able to entertain over 200 wedding couples during the happiest day of their lives and hearing the phrase, ""You were literally the life of the party. You made our wedding — we couldn't imagine it without you,"" truly humbles me and makes me want to entertain as many people as I can all over the world.


When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it? While I started my side hustle in March 2019, I've played the piano for more than 21 years and the alto saxophone for over 18 years. From an early age, I learned that I have a perfect pitch which has allowed me to play any song by ear.When I attended Rutgers, I became obsessed with mainstream house music. During my free time in college, I enjoyed spending hundreds of hours mixing dance tracks in my DJ software program to make mixes for my friends to play at parties (and even DJ'ed for my friends at parties from time to time, too). Around 2015, I started an Instagram account where I posted short videos of popular songs on the piano and sax (The Chainsmokers, Post Malone, Blink-182, Fetty Wap, etc.) and eventually was hired by a friend's sister to play cocktail hour piano at her wedding. She also had me play along with the DJ for her intro to her reception, and I ended up staying the entire wedding.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I was so attracted to the adrenaline rush from my first wedding that I became obsessed with replicating the feeling. I contacted several entertainment companies in the New Jersey/New York area and quickly started getting booked to play at events. Above any compliments I received about my musical talents on the sax and piano, I kept hearing the word ""energy."" ""Oh my God, you literally have so much energy"" and ""You're literally the life of the party"" were two phrases I heard over and over again, so I realized that my passion for entertaining others far outweighed any passion I've ever had for music.Related: This Gen Zer's Stylish Side Hustle Earns About $20,000 a Month and Paid Off His Parents' $200,000 Debt: 'I Enjoy the Hands-Off Nature'


While playing several events each weekend, I focused on building relationships with different vendors in my industry, including DJs, event planners, photographers, videographers and other entertainers. I also continued gathering content (both photo and video) from my events to grow my Instagram and TikTok accounts, where at least 50% of my event leads now come from. I'm so fortunate to be able to post content from weddings and other events and have the opportunity to reach virtually anyone across the entire world, which has led me to travel for incredible destination events in places like Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, and later this year, Aruba and Dubai.@essentialjasonnelson Wedding guest energy was off the charts at this one ?? #weddings #destinationweddings #rosecliffmansion #rosecliffmansionwedding #theknot #weddingwire #bridetobe ♬ original sound - THE ESSENTIAL JASON NELSONWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?I wanted to leave my 9-5 marketing job at the start of 2020, but once the pandemic hit in March, I lost practically all of my event bookings lined up for the rest of the year. However, I was so fortunate to still have a paycheck and work from home when most full-time event industry professionals were shut down. I remained patient and continued to grow my side hustle by networking virtually, posting content and working on the administrative part of my business because I knew it was only a matter of time before events came back. Sure enough, we saw a surge of events being played (including weddings) in 2021, and I knew I made the right decision to leave the 9-5 world.Since the majority of my event bookings are operated through my LLC (I don't have an agent or any employees), a few years ago, when I started receiving an increase in demand for myself at events, there was a period when I was overwhelmed with how manual the booking process was (scheduling calls, sending contracts and invoices, etc.). However, I started automating my booking process in 2022 using HoneyBook, which I now use to automate the process from a client inquiry through booking. I have so much more free time to devote to innovating my entertainment style in the ever-changing industry and can focus on getting myself physically ready to be on my feet and bring energy to the dance floor for many hours each weekend.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety.

How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?Within the first year of launching my side hustle, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to play the sax at Angelina Pivarnick of Jersey Shore's wedding and the grand opening party for The Edge NYC. Events like these so early on in my career gave me the confidence to want to take my side hustle full-time. I was on track to earn between $45,000 and $50,000 in 2020, and at the time, my goal was to find a way to replace my email marketing income.You've since turned the side hustle into a full-time business. What does total revenue look like now?I currently earn between $150,000 and $175,000 a year playing events and was fortunate to make $176,000 in 2023.What do you enjoy most about running your own business?Being able to share my love of entertaining others through joyful celebrations is what I love most about owning my own business. I also love the ability to set my own schedule and decide when I want to work and when I want to take time off for myself. I'm so thankful that I have full control over my business and continue to strive to find the perfect balance between my career and my personal life.Related: 4 Simple Mistakes That Can Crush Your Creative Side Hustle, From an Expert Who Raised $45 Million to Support Independent Workers


What's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?Ask yourself the question, If money didn't exist, what would you do? I never feel like I'm working because I love what I do. While it may be frustrating to not see an immediate ROI with customers and sales, continue to build your business based on what you'd do if money didn't exist so you can continue to have fun along the way and not get lost in why you started the business in the first place. Always be prepared, show up on time, strive to work well with others and be able to adapt to any and all situations.Find your strengths and triple down on them. What sets you apart from everybody else?Also, use social media to your advantage, especially since it's absolutely free to post!

28,How to Build a Workplace Community Where Everyone Thrives,"Mar 29, 2024",Matthew Waggoner,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-build-a-workplace-where-everyone-thrives/471576,"
Too often, companies fall into the trap of treating people as secondary to a product instead of seeing that without people, there would be no product. For small to midsize businesses, it's especially easy to lose connection with employees when the focus becomes all about automation, valuation and gross profit as they scale. But remember, if an organization grows to 2000 people, it's the first 20 who tend to establish and perpetuate the culture. So the question becomes, what kind of culture do you want to set initially?To get the best out of people — and for employees to get the best out of the company — leaders must treat the employer-employee relationship as a mutual partnership. Then, we must select for cultural fit to always build on that sense of community and belonging. One of my former CEOs summed it up best when he told me: ""I want you to help me create an environment where the weekend gets in the way."" He meant a workplace where people were so fulfilled in their jobs that the end of business on Friday felt like being taken away from what they love.Related: How To Build A Strong Culture With A Remote Team



Our people are more than a ""cost""The idea of taking a community-centered approach to running a business was crystalized in one of my first executive jobs, where I was in charge of a large healthcare company's call centers. The people who called in had real and urgent problems: They were sick, had an emergency or needed an appointment. But we had become so data-driven — focused on metrics like call handle times and calls-per-hour — that we had forgotten the human toll of these exchanges.My approach has always been for management teams to be open to empathetic dialogue if one of our representatives or nurses had trouble hitting their data. We needed to allow some latitude for patients to tell their stories rather than just cutting them off. It was a formative experience because I learned to look at the data behind the data — in other words, the human dimension of the business. However, my learning was far from done.


Related: What Happened to the Workplace? How to Make It More HumanDetermining root causes of attritionI have seen the link between many resignations across an organization and hiring managers treating people as a commodity. After doing a root-cause analysis, I found the overriding mentality is: ""If someone doesn't like it here, they should be happy just to have a job.""That was the polar opposite of the culture I wanted to drive. If you are experiencing a high turnover or attrition rate, there are two tried and tested methods for gauging why people are leaving. In both cases, never be afraid to hear the truth about your organization because that's where the solutions lie:Employee surveys: Look for trends in direct feedback. If different departments are losing people, it could be the culture of the entire organization. If the same things are mentioned consistently from one department, the issue is likely centralized. Watch out for data points that cluster around an outlier for underlying problems.Exit interviews: I ask people, ""If you were to ever return, what would you like to see us enhance or implement as an employer?"" Leaders still need a good filter to know when people are just venting, but these data points will reveal whether you are selecting the right people, posting in the right areas, or in too much of a rush to put warm bodies in place.Related: 7 Lessons CEOs and Hiring Managers Learned from Exit Interviews


How to change hiring practicesThe overarching theme of changing hiring practices to create a workplace community is choosing only people who possess the right skill set and fit for your team and culture. To get everybody from C-suite down to share this emphasis, here are five practices to follow:Agree on what type of culture you want because it will affect your choices. If you have a very collaborative organization, a more authoritarian or hierarchical leadership style is a poor fit.Prioritize the candidate profile over demographics. This approach almost builds without a name, face or gender to focus on cultural fit. It helps create a diverse, inclusive and thriving workplace community.Involve hiring managers in candidate screenings. There may be the temptation to select the most experienced person, but any red flags need to be included on the scorecard.Set realistic timing expectations. In companies that always innovate, sometimes hiring is rushed. Instead of hiring 20 different personalities, try hiring five who have the right profile and build from there. If it takes 45 or 90 days to get the right person, that's how long it takes.Build your workforce through employee referrals. People tend to refer those with similar values so then your community can build from within.Related: 10 Strategies for Hiring and Retaining New EmployeesCreating true partnershipThere are two other points to consider, both of which will come across in the interview — treat the hiring process as a two-way evaluation and give people time to decide. As VP of human resources, I still do interviews, which is what I tell candidates: ""I'm fully aware that you're interviewing us just as much as we are interviewing you. And you have the right to say 'no' if it's not the right fit because this is a partnership: You're going to hold me accountable to everything that I'm saying, and I'm going to hold you accountable to everything you're saying.""Community is built on this foundation of transparency, mutual trust and responsibility. After three decades in human resources, my message to business leaders as we all become more and more automated is this: Never forget who got us here. By giving someone time to accept or reject an offer, we are really allowing that person the space to feel like they are part of something bigger, rather than feeling lucky just to get a paycheck.

In 2022, Elenor Mak, now founder of doll company Jilly Bing, was busy balancing her business development role at a healthcare company and raising her 2-year-old and 4-year-old children. Back then, she ""was definitely not looking to start"" a side hustle. She'd founded an ecommerce fashion company in the past and knew what it took to get a business up and running. But that changed when her young daughter Jillian began playing with stuffed animals and dolls.Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak.""It reminded me of my own childhood,"" Mak tells Entrepreneur. ""You're playing with dolls; you're trying to make sense of the world. She was bossing her dolls around, like, 'Eat your dinner. Wash your hands.' Acting like a mom. Not in those words, but at age two, sort of using those words, simpler versions of those words.""

When Mak asked her why she'd chosen that doll instead of one that looked like her daughter, her mother said, ""It was the prettiest one on the shelf."" Despite knowing her mother meant well, Mak found those words ""so heavy,"" a reminder of her own experience with lack of representation as a child.


""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak decided to buy her daughter a doll that looked like her and figured it would be a straightforward process: Because I live in San Francisco, and it's 2022. But it wasn't. Her local toy store didn't have one. Neither did the second she visited. Or the third. The toy aisles at major retailers like Target and Toys""R""Us seemed as though they ""had not evolved"" since Mak was a kid, nearly four decades before.""There were just rows and rows of Caucasian dolls, brunettes, and then at the very end of the aisle, you would have these dolls that I think were intended to be Asian because they were holding a panda bear,"" Mak recalls. ""They gave them an Asian name, like Ling, or like a bad haircut. It was so shocking and disappointing.""Mak looked to Asia for more options, but asking her relatives what they could find only turned up ""Eurasian-looking dolls,"" she says, adding that ""dolls largely represent what society thinks is beautiful, and in Asia, what's beautiful is still the Caucasian sort of features."" Mak remembered wishing she were beautiful like the dolls she had growing up, and ""her mommy bear instincts"" kicked in — she was determined to get her daughter a doll that looked like her, even if she had to make it herself.

""It's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll.""Mak Googled ""how to make a doll,"" and armed with an MBA from Harvard Business School and her ""strong business background,"" she got to work on a side hustle that would shake up the $40 billion toy industry. Although she admits the creative component wasn't where she excelled (""My 6-year-old son is a better artist than me,"" she quips), she had a clear vision when it came to the business side and the potential for major demand: ""The Asian American population is one of the fastest-growing — we're 7% of the country's population.""And how hard could it be to make a doll in an age where we're churning out Teslas and developing AI? She recalls thinking. As it turns out, ""it's really hard — really hard — to make a good doll,"" Mak says. Fortunately, her business background helped her develop an essential ""superpower"": ""finding really good people."" Mak did cold outreaches to Asian designers at large toy brands and leveraged her own extensive network to connect with professionals who could bring the dream to life.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. Elenor Mak and her daughter Jillian with the Jilly doll.By June 2022, they had their team of four. Mak conducted a lot of research over the next several months, speaking with Asian families and looking at photographs of kids and dolls to really try to understand what parents wanted. ""It's not just about saying, 'Oh, this doll's Asian,'"" Mak says. ""But what mattered to them? What were the features? What were the backstories?"" In December of that year, the prototype for Jilly Bing, named for Mak's daughter Jillian and the Chinese word for cookie, ""bing gan"" (Jillian's first word), was ready to share with the world.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a Month""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child.'""Jilly Bing started shipping dolls in August 2023 — and sold out of its stock of 2,000 within six weeks. Greta Gerwig's blockbuster hit Barbie had also put the spotlight on dolls that summer, ""opening up the national conversation"" and presenting ""an opportunity for us to change the narrative for not just our Asian children, but all children,"" Mak says. At that point, Mak realized the ""high-risk, high-effort"" passion project she'd worked on as a side hustle for the past couple of years — taking late-night business calls after her kids were asleep and balancing it all with her full-time day job — would benefit from her undivided attention.Jilly Bing also appeared on the Today show around that time, and the positive response was ""overwhelming."" ""Adult women would write in and be like, 'Oh my gosh, it's like healing for my inner child. Life would have been so different if I had a doll that looked like me growing up,'"" Mak says. ""Even non-Asian parents writing [in to say], 'Oh my gosh, I think my kids should have dolls that look like their friends.'""By early this year, Jilly Bing was on shelves at Macy's; the retailer reached out after the Today segment. ""It's a company I grew up with,"" Mak says, ""so it was just really wonderful that they saw the value of Jilly Bing so early on."" Jilly Bing is also part of Macy's Mission Every One initiative, which has committed $5 billion of spending through 2025 to its people, partners, products and programs ""to create a more equitable and sustainable future.""Related: How This Doctor-Turned-Entrepreneur Is Trying to Change the World Through Play


""Seeing the kids' reactions to having a doll that looks like them keeps me going [more than] everything else.""To date, Jilly Bing has sold approximately 5,000 dolls, Mak says. At $68 apiece, that's more than $300,000 in sales.And Mak's favorite part about running her business? That would be the testimonials from her young customers. ""It's seeing the photos,"" Mak says. ""And hearing the stories [from them] — and my own daughter — saying, 'She looks like me. She has black hair like me.' [And] little Asian boys saying, 'She's beautiful like my mama.' It's just seeing the kids' reactions to having a doll that looks like them that keeps me going [more than] everything else.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Jilly Bing. 


Mak had to ""trust her gut"" to start the side hustle turned full-fledged business that's leaving its mark on the toy industry and beyond, and she looks forward to building the brand out in the years to come.""I am most excited about being able to create characters,"" Mak says. ""We started to branch into comics because it's a doll, but we're starting to create the stories. I've got a vision of a whole cast of Asian American characters that actually reflect what Asian America looks like today. We have mixed Asian children, you have boys, you have Southeast Asian. Jilly's our first doll, so I'm excited to grow and introduce the world to the rest of Jilly Bing's friends.""

30,"Is a Master's Degree Worth It for Aspiring Entrepreneurs, or Does It Just Delay Success? Here's What You Should Know.","Mar 27, 2024",Hanna Shanar,https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/is-a-masters-degree-worth-it-for-aspiring-entrepreneurs/470461,"
In the realm of entrepreneurship and career advancement, the decision to pursue higher education often comes down to a critical analysis of cost versus opportunity cost. This analysis becomes even more pertinent when considering the financial implications of obtaining a master's degree compared to entering the workforce with a bachelor's degree.With the average income for bachelor's degree holders at $60,000 per year and the cost of a master's degree running at $30,000 per year over two years, the decision is not merely financial but strategic.Understanding cost and opportunity costBefore delving into the specifics, it's essential to differentiate between cost and opportunity cost. Cost refers to the tangible expenses incurred during the pursuit of education, such as tuition, books, and living expenses. Opportunity cost, however, represents the income or benefits one foregoes by choosing one path over another. For an aspiring entrepreneur or professional, understanding this distinction is vital for making informed decisions that align with long-term goals.



Related: Exploring the Intricate Interplay of Education, Income and Entrepreneurial SuccessThe financials: A closer lookThe average cost of obtaining a master's degree is $60,000 over two years. This figure does not account for ancillary expenses, including potential interest on loans, which can further increase the total investment. On the surface, this cost is counterbalanced by the promise of a higher average income post-graduation, which stands at $80,000 for master's degree holders.


However, this simplistic view overlooks the opportunity cost associated with pursuing a master's degree. For two years, an individual forgoes an average income of $60,000 annually, amounting to $120,000 in lost earnings. This figure significantly impacts the net benefit of obtaining a master's degree, especially when considering the time value of money and potential investments that could have been made with the income earned during this period.The entrepreneurial perspectiveFor entrepreneurs and those with a keen eye on career advancement, the decision to pursue a master's degree is not solely about immediate financial returns. The value of higher education often extends beyond the paycheck. Advanced degrees can provide invaluable networks, specialized knowledge and credibility that can be particularly beneficial in certain industries or entrepreneurial ventures.Moreover, the skills and insights gained during the pursuit of a master's degree can lead to more significant opportunities, potentially resulting in ventures that far exceed the income differential between bachelor's and master's degree holders. Therefore, while the opportunity cost is a critical consideration, it's also essential to weigh these intangible benefits.Calculating the break-even pointTo make an informed decision, one must calculate the break-even point of their educational investment. This calculation considers the total cost of the degree, the opportunity cost of lost earnings and the differential in post-graduation earnings. Specifically, with a total financial investment of $180,000 — comprising $60,000 in tuition and $120,000 in lost income — it would take nine years of working at an $80,000 annual income to break even. When including the two years spent obtaining the master's degree, the total time investment to reach a break-even point is precisely 11 years.


This break-even analysis is crucial for those contemplating a master's degree, as it provides a clear timeline for when the financial benefits of the degree will start to outweigh the costs and lost earnings. It's a vital consideration that requires individuals to take a long-term view of their career trajectory and financial goals.Related: The Most Effective Way to Become a Millionaire Is Still Through Education. Here's Why.Beyond the numbers: The value of educationWhile the financial analysis of cost versus opportunity cost is crucial, the decision to pursue a master's degree should also consider personal and professional growth. Education is not merely a financial transaction but an investment in one's capabilities, worldview and potential to impact society. For those with a clear vision of their career path or entrepreneurial goals, the value of a master's degree might far exceed its initial cost and opportunity cost.Moreover, in an increasingly complex and competitive global economy, the depth of knowledge and expertise gained through a master's degree can be a significant differentiator. This is particularly true for entrepreneurs who seek to innovate and lead in their respective fields.


Making the decision: A strategic approachThe decision to pursue a master's degree, with its inherent costs and opportunity costs, requires a strategic approach. Prospective students and entrepreneurs should:Conduct a thorough financial analysis, including the calculation of the break-even pointConsider the intangible benefits of higher education, such as networking opportunities, skill development and access to resourcesReflect on their career goals and the role that a master's degree might play in achieving those objectivesExplore alternative paths to acquiring the desired skills and knowledge, such as professional certifications, online courses or practical experienceIn conclusion, the analysis of cost versus opportunity cost in the context of higher education is a complex but essential exercise for entrepreneurs and professionals. By taking a holistic and strategic approach to this decision, individuals can align their educational pursuits with their long-term career and entrepreneurial aspirations, ensuring that their investment yields not just financial returns but personal and professional fulfillment.Related: How to Get a Master's Degree Without Going Into Debt

Avni Barman explains how she managed to get a $40,000 raise by working smarter, not harder, using the 


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. In 2022, I had my first-ever promotion. I was working as an associate product manager at Atlassian and received a raise of $40,000. It wasn't because I was the hardest worker or an exceptional employee, but because I employed what some call the ""lazy girl strategy.""This ""lazy girl strategy"" is really just about being proactive about sharing my work successes in an efficient way.



My career trajectory — from being a software engineering intern at LinkedIn to a product manager at Atlassian to now as the CEO of Generation She — has been marked by a significant realization: ""Loud work always wins, not hard work.""The truth is that smart work is often just as effective as — if not more so than — hard work, especially in large companies.


Through my experience, I realized that the belief that promotions are reserved only for workaholics is a myth that needs to be debunked. I was able to climb the ladder without burning out, and the best part was that it only took me 30 seconds a day.Capture daily impactFor many of us, our jobs on a day-to-day basis are composed of mini-actions rather than really big projects.Spend 30 seconds each day capturing a screenshot of the most impactful thing you did, and store these screenshots in a folder. This could be anything from a message you sent to a coworker that saved them time to a milestone in a project.Doing so will make it easier for you to add up all of your small wins into a few large wins at the end of the year and show noticeable impact on the company.Here's one way you could catalog your daily wins:Avni Barman via BII've also written a full guide with specific examples and templates you can use here.Just doing this alone will get you 90% of the way there.However, here are some additional strategies for career advancement that I employed to get promoted.1. Prioritize key metricsRather than attempting to excel in every single task, prioritize what truly matters in your job. Focus on your role's key metrics and strive to deliver on them.I maintained a monthly call with my manager, in addition to our weekly syncs, where I could reconfirm that I was still working on the right things that mattered for the company and for my role. This regular check-in is vital because company priorities can shift rapidly, and you want to ensure that you're always working on impactful tasks that can lead to a promotion, not just putting in hours.


I also employed a framework called ""start, stop, and continue"" to ensure my work was aligned with my manager's expectations. Every month, I made sure I was receiving actionable steps on what to start doing, what I should stop doing, and what I was doing well and should continue doing rather than abstract feedback that could often be confusing to implement in practice.2. Quantify your contributionsNot only is keeping track of all of your contributions crucial, but quantifying the impact of all your achievements, no matter how small, is also important because, at the end of the year, the outcomes of big projects may not seem to offer enough quantifiable metrics to justify a significant promotion.However, since you've accumulated and documented hundreds of small achievements throughout the year, you can add them all up to calculate the time or money saved for the company and make a strong case for a larger promotion.Avni Barman via BI3. Make Yourself Regularly VisibleConsistently communicate your achievements to your team and leadership. It's essential to make your successes known. Now that you've documented your small wins, share them early and often.I actively worked to highlight my contributions; for example, my manager suggested that I create a Slack channel exclusively with the leadership team, where I posted weekly updates on my accomplishments. They might not have always responded, but it ensured I remained at the forefront of their minds.I also blogged on the company wiki about my team's achievements every month and scheduled quarterly meetings with leadership to review my work. No one asked me to do these things; I initiated and led them.


Taking these steps greatly enhanced my visibility and played a key role in my eventual promotion.4. Follow-up consistentlyAfter highlighting your achievements, the next step is to engage in consistent follow-up and embrace a mindset of continual improvement. This includes sending thoughtful thank-you emails after meetings, actively seeking feedback for improvement, pursuing relevant learning opportunities, and actively participating in team meetings.Building strong internal relationships is also key. Periodic check-ins with your manager will help keep your progress and career aspirations on their radar.Securing a promotion is just the beginning — maintaining open communication and continually striving for growth are what will propel your career forward.


The ""lazy girl strategy"" isn't actually lazy or just for womenHow you package and present your work to leadership when seeking a promotion is as important as the work itself, and the ""lazy girl strategy"" can help you efficiently do so.The term ""lazy girl strategy"" is a bit misleading, though, as it isn't about encouraging women to be lazy. Instead, I see it as a clever approach to describe effective and efficient strategies that allow women to better advocate for themselves without overextending or constantly feeling the need to prove their worth.This is especially important for women in male-dominated workforces. When I was working in tech, I noticed women's work and efforts would often go unnoticed, and we frequently had to exert twice the effort to receive the same recognition as men.""Lazy girl strategy"" challenges the notion that constant busyness equals success. The idea of working less can initially feel like laziness, but it's important to remember that having some free time or focusing on fewer, high-impact tasks is not laziness — it's working smarter.


While the ""lazy girl strategy"" may serve as an effective coping mechanism in the short term, it's also crucial to continue pushing for systemic change in the workplace. My goal in founding Gen She is to provide ambitious young women with the skills and resources to be the leaders of tomorrow so that other women don't need to use the ""lazy girl strategy"" to be seen and valued at work.But in the meantime, the ""lazy girl strategy"" helped me get a $40,000 raise, and perhaps it could help you too.Avni Barman is the founder and CEO of Generation She and a former product manager at Atlassian.

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2015, at 18, Cao heard about a lucrative business opportunity from a friend: reselling sneakers.
      


        He joined online forums like Reddit to conduct research — then started purchasing online drops. 
      


        After a while, he automated the process, and the venture has generated more than $1.5 million in total revenue.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Ray Cao, a Gen Z seller on StockX, an online marketplace and sneaker reseller. Image Credit: Courtesy of Ray CaoWhat was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?I was a student working as a part-time barista earning about $8 an hour (minimum wage at the time) at a bubble tea store in New York City. My family had gotten into $200,000 worth of debt from speculative investments and gambling. We were desperate to the point where my parents borrowed from relatives to get by. This put an obvious strain on the relationship between them, and my family would quickly become the topic of untoward gossip. I was ashamed, scared and insecure. I eventually cultivated these feelings of vulnerability into action and dove into entrepreneurship.



When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I started the side hustle in 2015 when I had just turned 18. Sneaker and streetwear culture was growing popular, and demand for these coveted brands trended higher. I heard from my friend that this would be a lucrative business opportunity, and we both pursued it. My inspiration for starting and continuing this business was always my immigrant family.Related: I Was a 25-Year-Old Nurse When I Started a Side Hustle to Combat Anxiety. It Made $1 Million in 7 Months — Then Sold for a Life-Changing Amount.


Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I grew to understand that I was much poorer than my peers. My parents were seamstresses and worked around the clock to support the family. My mom would tell me that she only earned a dime for each fabric she had sewn together, totaling only $200 weekly. Even my late grandma would spend her days picking up bottles and cans to recycle for five cents per piece. My parents and grandma navigated their lives here through sacrifice, cultural disparity and language differences. To this day, their story continues to fuel my ambitions and keeps me progressing.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I joined online communities and forums (Reddit, Facebook, NikeTalk) to conduct research and opened a bank account and card to purchase online drops. Eventually, I bought my first item, Supreme Air Jordan Desert Camo 5s (2015), for $225 and sold them locally for a $400 profit.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?As college progressed and my finance career came into focus, I didn't have the energy to grind through the manual labor required for the business (sorting through incoming inventory, shipping outbound orders, conducting quality checks and dealing with returns from purchases and sales). I automated the business through Excel spreadsheets and worked with my parents to facilitate the day-to-day operations. During this time, I also gained access to store inventory at the StockX warehouse. This dramatically reduced my active work time and involvement to 10 hours a month. Everything I needed to manage the business could now be done from my laptop anywhere in the world.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money. Subscribe to Entrepreneur+ now.


As my available capital increased, a new challenge sprouted: order sizing. For example, with $1,000 and a hype release, it was easy to size my order — as much as I could afford. When that available capital increases a hundredfold or a thousandfold, things become more complex. I remember placing a roughly $10,000 order for the Nike Blazer Mid 77 Vintage White Black. About the first 30 sold at a 15% premium, but demand dried up as I flooded the market with available pairs. I lost about $3,000 and quickly learned the importance of order sizing and liquidity.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?During the early growth stages, monthly revenue trended closely with the amount of capital that was readily available. As the business matured, monthly revenues in the past two years peaked at a little under $20,000.What does total revenue look like now?I've earned about $1.53 million in total revenue on StockX.What do you enjoy most about this side hustle?I enjoy the hands-off nature of this business because it allows me to simultaneously progress my finance career (whether it's a new business venture or another corporate gig). The network of partners and relationships I've built along the way is invaluable, and so is being surrounded by so many smart individuals — special shoutout to the StockX team!

Your network is a major barrier to growth, so take every opportunity to show potential partners the value you can bring them. Good information is valuable and scarce: Conduct your market research within small niche communities and build connections organically.

Whether it's a specific routine or tried-and-true perseverance, there's a lot of advice on the ""to-dos"" of success.But what about the things to avoid?There are as many ways to limit your success as stepping stones to lead you to where you want to be. Avoid getting in your own way and making it harder to get to your destination. There's plenty not to do to prepare for success as well. Here are nine things to avoid. Often, simply switching to a more positive mindset (eliminating negative habits) can clear the path.



1. Neglect self-careToo often, entrepreneurs focus on the grind alone without taking breaks or paying attention to their physical and mental health. This isn't sustainable and will lead to burnout or, worse, giving up on their business dreams altogether.Schedule time to exercise, sit down for meals and sleep at approximately the same time every night. These simple habits are as important as any metrics to measure your business success. By taking care of your health, you'll see the difference in your energy and outlook, which only helps fuel your growth.


2. Doubt yourselfSelf-doubt plagues every entrepreneur, at least in the beginning. Being your own boss means you need to be your own cheerleader as well. Turn to trusted peers and friends to give you constructive feedback when needed, but keep confident in your abilities.Once you begin second-guessing your choices, it becomes harder to move forward. Getting stuck due to indecision or feelings of unworthiness creates additional barriers. As entrepreneurs, there's already enough of those to deal with.Instead, explore different things and experiment with what works. Not every move will be perfect, but everyone can help you learn and improve as you go, which makes for a better entrepreneur and a better business.Related: The Biggest Threat to Your Boundaries Isn't Your Boss or Family — There's Someone Else You Need to Face First


3. Refuse to ask for helpEven if you have years of experience in your industry, stay humble enough to know when you need guidance. Trying to juggle every aspect can be overwhelming and means you don't have time to concentrate on the things that really matter.You must consider not only your trade or craft but also accounting, taxes, marketing and all the other aspects that help you grow. Whether it's advisory support from a respected colleague or outsourcing help for things like social media or copywriting to build your brand, delegating tasks helps you grow your business.4. Avoid networkingBuilding strong professional relationships leads to limitless opportunities. Expand your connections by networking with those both in and beyond your field. Start online through LinkedIn. Interact with posts and share helpful information of your own.Also, attend in-person events to meet with like-minded individuals. It will expand your business circle, and networking can be motivational as you take your business to the next step. You never know who might cross your path and who may be a valuable resource for you or vice versa.

Aiming high is great, but taking it step by step is a more realistic way to get you to your goals and continue once you reach them. Don't put off your goals because they seem out of reach today. Instead, put steps into place that can lead there so you get closer to your goal every day until you realize you've arrived at its doorstep.6. Overlook planningPlanning is the catalyst that helps you reach your goals. Without a plan, days go unstructured, and it's easy to do many small things that aren't linked to any objectives. Instead, take time at the beginning and end of each day to look at the day/week ahead.Also, prioritize deadlines. Though everything may seem urgent, trying to do it all at once means fewer things are likely to get done or, at least, get done well. Being an entrepreneur means balancing schedules to ensure you have enough creative time to dream and enough productivity time to do.

Explore new areas where you can take the next leap and avoid getting too comfortable. It could be speaking on a panel, authoring an online article, or broadening your services.There is always another lesson to learn or another goal to create. Stay curious and eager to head to what's next. However, don't skip over the wins, big or small.Related: Want Success? You Have to Take Risks.


8. Minimize winsThere was once a time when you wanted to be an entrepreneur, and you put the plan into action to make that come true. Every time you achieve something, make sure to celebrate the win.It can be a revenue goal, a new client, or even crossing off your weekly to-do list. Looking back and adding up all the wins motivates you to keep going and lets you know you have what it takes to succeed.9. Stray from valuesAlways hold true to your values no matter how much success you achieve. When people slip away from their integrity, it trips them up and prevents future success.Stay aligned with your vision, work ethic, and how you treat people. You will go further when you align, and the wins will feel all the more worth it.

      Key Takeaways    



        Sarah Michelle Boes followed her passion for teaching into nursing school. 
      


        After passing her nurse practitioner's exam proved easier than expected, she wanted to instill confidence in others. 
      


        She put together her first course within a week of that exam — and became a millionaire within the year. 
      












This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sarah Michelle Boes, the founder of Sarah Michelle NP Reviews (SMNP), which was acquired by Blueprint Test Prep in 2022. Boes currently serves as the chief nursing officer for Blueprint Test Prep and hosts the podcast Becoming A Stress-Free Nurse Practitioner. She earned her BSN from the University of Kentucky, her MSN in Nursing Education from Western Governors University and her post-MSN-FNP from Eastern Kentucky University. The piece has been edited and condensed for clarity. Image Credit: Courtesy of Sarah Michelle BoesI grew up in rural Eastern Kentucky, and I always had this passion for being a teacher. I had my heart set on it. But my parents are teachers, and they're like, ""Absolutely not. You can't do that."" There are a lot of politics and bureaucracy within teaching. It's a lot more than just being an educator. Then, when I was a teenager, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Without great access to premium healthcare in our area, we had to travel two hours to Lexington to get that diagnosis and receive a care plan that she could take back home. That was over the summer, so I went with her, and that was my first introduction to nursing at the Markey Cancer Center.



Those nurses were incredible. I feel like oncology nurses, in general, are kind of angels. Not only did they take care of her, but they also took care of me. It was just a great experience. So, knowing that I wasn't going to be able to be a teacher, I was like, Well, nursing — I feel like I could get something done. And there would be a teaching aspect because there's a lot of patient education, but I'd also get a human connection with people, which I thrive off of. So it was a no-brainer, and I attended the University of Kentucky, which guaranteed me admission to their program — and that's a really big deal.Related: This Nurse Turned $500 in Savings Into $100 Million in Sales After Sharing Her Hair Care Routine on YouTube. Now She's Revealing Her Secrets to Success.


I grappled with anxiety during nursing school. A class was notorious for weeding out people, and everyone dreaded taking it. I had a ton of anxiety in that class in particular, so much so that my instructor was like, ""I don't think nursing is for you. You're too anxious to be a safe nurse."" I had to choose to stay. The grading scale in nursing is also very different: In most programs, anything less than a 76 means you fail — and on the first exam in that class, I got a 74. I literally failed the first exam by one question. So I had to figure out how to contend with my anxiety, to think about the tools I could use.So, I started to figure out how to manage that class and my anxiety. Then, I began tutoring, ultimately quitting my full-time job as a manager to help students full-time. I taught them the skills that had helped me tackle that challenging class in a different way, and my anxiety didn't pick up again until I was a nurse practitioner — because it had been a long time since I'd taken a high-stakes exam. There was no one to turn to get perspective because I was the first nurse in my family, and I didn't know many people who were nurse practitioners.What's more, I took my nurse practitioner exam in the prime of Covid, May 2020. So it was chaos. Testing centers were down, and some places would let you take it online at home, but others wouldn't. By the time I took the exam in the middle of May, it had been canceled five times, three of which I'd already arrived at the testing center. So, there was a lot of anxiety involved. I was like, Am I ever going to take this test? My job is riding on this.Related: Nurse Makes $2 Million In One Year With Side Hustle Selling Class Notes Online


I was so stressed that I ended up breaking a tooth in my sleep because I was grinding them so hard. I was going to have to get a dental implant to the tune of $7,000; my hair was also falling out. But I finished the 175-question exam in less than an hour, and I passed. I was like, I can't believe I was stressing over this thing. This was so much easier than my nursing exam. All I needed was confidence in myself because I'd spent years in schools and hundreds of hours in clinical preparing. None of my reviews had given me that confidence.That realization — and the fact that I still had to pay for a $7,000 dental implant — motivated me to put together my first review course. I started my business because I was like, I can't afford this $7,000 implant. I figured if I put together a little review course and even just earned $500, that would help pay for it. And I started to think about how it could be done differently — how it could be less like someone lecturing you and more like studying with a friend. So, I came up with a Q&A approach, which I'd used as a tutor in nursing school and when I taught nursing students at the collegiate level.Within a week of passing the exam, I made my first three-hour course. I actually gave it out to all of my classmates for free. There were 30 of us, and I was like, ""Hey guys, I'll give you this course for free if you invite someone else into the group when I give it to you."" I gave the course to the first 100 people who came into the group. Then, not even a couple of days later, someone who had taken the course went on to pass, and it kind of exploded through word of mouth. It got wild really quickly. The first person I tried to sell it to for $25 got mad because her friend had gotten it for free, so she haggled me down to $15. Still, I made $1,000 on the first day I started selling, and I didn't even make $1,000 in a week as a nurse. I was like, What if I made $1,000 a day, every day? What would life look like?Related: Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a Year


By the end of June and July, I'd surpassed what I used to make annually as a nurse. I told my nurse practitioner job I wouldn't be coming. I wanted to see how far I could take the business, but being reasonable and never having run a business before, I kept my full-time teaching job, just in case. But every spare hour I had, every weekend, was all about the business. Because I was so anxious about it being a startup, fragile and new, I waited to quit my teaching job until I made $1 million. We hit seven figures in seven months.About a year and a half in, I was still using third-party software to host my courses — nothing was in-house or really in unison. It got to the point where my students were literally breaking the software; I needed my own. We actually spent $100,000 trying to build an app that ended up completely falling apart. That was really hard, but we just kept running up against technology, and I realized I was the bottleneck to this thing. The business wanted to grow, so I started looking into other options.We considered a sale and put out some teasers, hoping to get constructive feedback. As it turned out, the test prep provider Blueprint had some internal meetings about the prospect before I even sent out the teaser. They had medical stuff, and they had LSAT stuff, but they didn't have any nursing material at the time. And I wanted to take some pressure off myself because a week into sending out the teasers, I found out I was pregnant. I never want people to think I sold because I was pregnant; it just coincided with the timing.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part


We loved the Blueprint team, but the deal just wasn't right at first. My husband and I had decided on a number before we had a single conversation, and I'd recommend any entrepreneur do the same. Otherwise, it can be hard to navigate a deal when emotions are running high. So the first deal wasn't our number, and we walked away. Then they came back with our number, and we ended up selling around the two-year mark. That money has been life-changing.At 36 weeks pregnant, we found out that my daughter was going to have a congenital heart defect. We had no idea. So everything kind of flipped on its head really quickly. When I gave birth, the money gave us the flexibility and ability to be with our daughter when she needed it the very most. She had six surgeries in her first five months of life, two of which were open-heart surgeries. So, very crazy, chaotic times, and what a blessing to be able to have not only a maternity leave, but also a medical leave, and to be able to be fully present for that — and not only me but also my husband. We could be there together and support one another.Now, my daughter is 19 months old, and for the past year, we've been working to do a legacy gift to our local children's hospital, where they literally saved her life. Hopefully, next month, fingers crossed, everything's going to be finished, and they're actually going to dedicate the Norton Children's Heart Institute to my daughter. They are trying to build out a premier heart program there, and you have to have the funds to be able to do that. So the money gives us a lot of freedom and flexibility — my husband's also starting up his own business — but our work with the children's hospital is the most meaningful and impactful accomplishment.This article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a Young Entrepreneur®.

Ben Huffman, CEO and co-founder of Contra, knows what it takes to run a successful freelancing side hustle. Huffman got firsthand experience in the freelancing space as a music producer, working with small labels and, ultimately, Sony Music. The work was fun but ""didn't pay well,"" he tells Entrepreneur, so he started designing apps, pitch decks and websites. Huffman became a ""power user"" on Elance and Odesk, which would merge to become Upwork, and soon ""became fascinated"" with the idea of building a team globally.Image Credit: Courtesy of Contra. Ben Huffman.""I would find projects locally in New York and then hire freelancers from all over the world to help me with the skills I didn't have,"" Huffman recalls. ""I loved the freedom and autonomy of working independently, but even more, I loved working with people from different cultures and backgrounds. Early on, I realized the flaws in the business models of the platforms I used.""



The world was becoming more connected, Huffman explains, and the ""take-rate model"" eBay brought to the fore ""didn't make sense for people and working relationships,"" especially as workers increasingly sought flexibility and employers needed more niche skills. So Huffman set out to create a platform that could address those pain points, and after interviewing thousands of independent workers, discovered they need to think about three things to be successful: creating their identity and credibility, managing their business and finding new leads. Contra, which has raised $45 million from venture capital firms, provides support in all of those areas.Related: How to Start a Freelance Writing Side Hustle


""Contra is commission-free, so our users can keep 100% of their earnings.""""Independent workers can create a profile that showcases their skills and what they can actually do instead of their roles at past companies,"" Huffman says. ""Focusing on projects and skills allows independents to highlight the specific problems they've solved and the value they've delivered. Independents can find new projects from high-quality, vetted clients, manage their business with our free invoices, contracts and proposals, and, most importantly, they can get paid. Contra is commission-free, so our users can keep 100% of their earnings.""Nowadays, nearly two in five U.S. adults have a side hustle, and one in three of them say they use their side hustle earnings to cover everyday expenses, according to a Bankrate survey. Freelance projects can be an accessible, flexible option for people hoping to capitalize on their skill sets, but the most successful will be those who avoid the common pitfalls of the job.Related: 10 of the Most Profitable Side Hustles You Can Start With Little or No MoneyHuffman shares four mistakes that could hinder any side-hustler's success:1. Underpricing your services to attract your first clients""Going down this route can devalue your work,"" Huffman explains, ""and make raising prices much more challenging in the future. Before solidifying your prices, get to know the market you're entering, track industry rates, consider your years of experience and outline your unique expertise; these variables will help you determine a price that works for you and your clients.""2. Not prioritizing your projects the right way""It's important to prioritize projects that fully align with your skill set and politely turn down projects that could be a better fit with someone else,"" Huffman says. ""While many first-time freelancers may regret turning down new projects, taking on too much work can often lead to being overwhelmed and subpar work.""3. Not learning new in-demand skills""Right now, we are seeing a ton of demand for skills like Framer for building websites, video animation and social media management,"" Huffman says. ""There is also a huge opportunity to upskill in the latest AI tools. So much of the world of work is changing because of AI, and there is a huge opportunity to get ahead of it all.""

Not going the extra mile for your clients""Going above and beyond with clients can lead to referrals, more projects in the future and a reputation that will help you build longer-lasting relationships,"" Huffman says. ""To set up any project for success, you will want a well-scoped out set of deliverables and project timeline. Once you have this, you should get everything put into a contract so that you have a framework for your agreement and protection if things get off track.""And one last piece of advice for side hustle success? While growing your network of clients is important, don't forget to cultivate a network of other independent consultants, too. ""Having a community of fellow freelancers to bounce ideas off of and get advice from is invaluable and can lead to new leads in the future,"" Huffman says.

38,"She Never Wanted to Start a Business, But Chronic Insomnia Was Motivation — Here's How She Achieved 8 Figures in Sales and 8 Hours of Sleep a Night","Mar 19, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/bearabys-founder-surpassed-20m-in-sales-gets-better-sleep/471256,"
Dr. Kathrin Hamm, founder and CEO of sleep-wellness company Bearaby, never wanted to be an entrepreneur. After graduating with her Ph.D. in economics, she started as an economist at the World Bank. Her work took her all over the world and provided invaluable insight into the small, medium and women-founded enterprises she tried to convince banks to lend to — but she ""learned firsthand how hard it is, especially in developing countries, for women to get access to finance and start and grow their businesses.""During her time in India and Bangladesh especially, Hamm faced long, ""exhausting"" travel days. She'd ""never been a good sleeper,"" waking easily even as a child, and she developed a chronic case of insomnia. It began ""on a more moderate level,"" with difficulty falling and staying asleep, before the periods of wakefulness became longer and longer, motivating her to look into different solutions.Image Credit: Courtesy of Bearaby. Kathrin Hamm.



She started by investigating various mattress options, but when she dug deeper, she found an article discussing weighted blankets. The piece focused on helping children with sensory issues, Hamm recalls, but it also mentioned that evenly distributed weight on an adult body could support better sleep. Hamm was immediately intrigued — as a potential customer.Related: The No-Excuse Approach to Sleep and Work Performance for Entrepreneurs


""Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""""I came from a consumer lens,"" Hamm says, ""and knowing how hard it is for women to start a business, I [was] like, Yeah, I'm good here. I don't want to start a business or even think about becoming an entrepreneur. Let me buy a product, sleep better and then move on with my career.""However, the purchase process proved difficult. Unable to find options online, Hamm had to go to a pharmacy in Germany, where she's from, to place an order. Six weeks later, a ""big bean bag"" arrived. It was orange and blue and ""very noisy,"" Hamm says. She was reluctant to even try it at first and wondered if she'd made a mistake.""But then I put it on during the day on a weekend, and I just passed out after 10 minutes,"" Hamm says. ""And I woke up more than two hours later, [after] a solid nap, completely passed out, and I'm like, Wow, this is magic. This thing works for me.""

Let Your Employees Take Naps.So Hamm kept using the blanket at night, but there was a problem: Because the blanket was filled with plastic beads to add weight, she often got too hot. The underlying functionality works; the weight on my body works, Hamm remembers thinking, but how it is made doesn't work. After some research, Hamm discovered that the technology, which largely consisted of bead-filled chambers between layers of blanket, had been around for 30 years — ""Nobody had innovated anything about this product.""""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?""Hamm decided to experiment with alternative designs. She drew some inspiration from her time spent in India, ""where there's a culture of making rugs, knitting, crocheting,"" but the ultimate breakthrough came from a conversation with her mom. Hamm had been considering changing the material or adding holes for airflow when her mom said, ""Why can't you just use strips of cotton?"" They would create a thick yarn that could be knit together for natural airflow, eliminating the need for heavy artificial materials that shift around and reduce comfort. That idea led to the development of Bearaby's first small blanket, made from a cut-up t-shirt.


Confident she was onto something, Hamm opted to take a year's leave from her job to focus on the business. ""I didn't want to take too much of a risk, again, knowing that it can get really hard,"" she admits. ""[But] my boss was super supportive, and she said, 'Look, if it doesn't work out, we make a case study out of it.'""Hamm withdrew $120,000 from her retirement fund and raised just over $250,000 from a crowdfunding campaign to fund the prototypes for the first batch of blankets. She also looked into patents, but they were expensive, so she did the drawing herself, then had a lawyer put together a provisional patent application, which entitles the filer to 18 months before they have to pay more money. That went through just a couple of days before launch in December 2018; the blanket sold out in two weeks and was the only product of its kind on the market for a couple of years, Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyRelated: How to Take Advantage of the 'First-to-File' Patent System


Despite the early success, the more than 50 factories that Hamm approached weren't inclined to take on the product. They'd never seen anything like it: It wasn't apparel, and it wasn't bedding. So, for that first year and a half, Hamm rented a small garage outfitted with knitting machines and knitters to churn out the first products. The strong sales helped the business continue to finance production, which was a good thing, too — because people still weren't all that interested in investing in the first-of-its-kind product.""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable.""Hamm leaned into the ""bootstrap"" mentality, which was a blessing in disguise. ""In hindsight, we had to learn to be profitable,"" she explains, ""to become in tune with our production processes and marketing processes, to be efficient, which sometimes you didn't see at that time in the direct-to-consumer space. Everyone was like, 'I raised that much money, and I'm putting that much million on a marketing spend.' So we never had it, but now, in an environment where money is not flowing [as] freely, we never had that money in the first place, so we are feeling pretty good right now.""Bearaby saw another major advantage in brand loyalty. Hamm notes that people seeking wellness and sleep tend to form an ""emotional connection"" with the blanket,"" and that it's easy to fall in love with a brand that helps you sleep better. Substantial interest also translated into an early retail presence. Just five months in, Bearaby was in West Elm, thanks to customers who walked in and wanted to try the blanket. That happened with Nordstrom, too.


Related: Customer Loyalty Is Your Holy Grail for Success. Here's How to Cultivate It.As Bearaby considered expansion, it centered on functional products that would uphold its commitment to quality and sustainability (the company is certified by third-party organizations, including The Global Organic Textile Standard, The Forest Stewardship Council and The Global Recycled Standard). Because anxiety so often goes hand in hand with insomnia, the company landed on its warmables line; boasting a weighted and heated neck wrap, bottle and lap pad, it ""takes the nervous system to zero,"" Hamm says.Image Credit: Courtesy of BearabyNaturally, Bearaby's products have become an integral part of Hamm's own sleep routine, and as she's gotten older, she's realized even more just how much sleep she actually needs. ""Now I sleep for a minimum of eight hours,"" she says. ""I'm training myself to get nine to 10 hours of sleep, obviously not every night, but definitely every weekend. Also, [it helps] whenever I get a chance to take a nap, like just a 20-minute nap to reset. [I make sure that I have] these conscious breaks, whether [it's] napping or deep breathing because running a business is a marathon, and if we don't take care of our bodies, we're not able to do that over a very long time.""


""Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""Hamm's five-year marathon with Bearaby has led to over eight figures in sales and more than 10 patents — but it all started with a single, somewhat reluctant leap of faith. And according to the founder, that's exactly what it takes to be successful.""Once you believe in a product, just take a chance and give yourself a year,"" Hamm says. ""It's much more manageable if you [have] a considerable time frame where it's like, Okay, in that year, I'm giving everything I have, 100%. Because sometimes we second guess ourselves. After [a few] months or six weeks, we don't see the success, [and] we start doubting ourselves. You say [I have] one year, and I'm not asking if this is working. Just have tunnel vision for one year, and then reevaluate after those 365 days.""This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

In 1991, the average reported retirement age was 57; in 2022, it was 61, according to a Gallup survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults.The increase is perhaps not surprising given recent inflationary pressure, but it paints a troubling picture of what's ahead if Americans don't set themselves up for retirement in the years to come.And a new survey from personal finance resource GOBakingRates suggests that many of them won't. The research, which surveyed over 1,000 U.S. adults, revealed that nearly 40% of Americans are contributing nothing to a retirement fund — and 30% of them say they'll never be able to retire.

40,She Cashed in $100K of Her Retirement Savings to Start a Business. Here's What Happened.,"Mar 18, 2024",Kim Kavin,https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/she-cashed-in-100k-of-her-retirement-savings-to-start-a/470085,"
Sometimes, building the life you want requires a big risk.That's what Keri Gardner realized when she cashed in $100,000 of her retirement savings to buy a franchise. It was November 2020, and she had just been laid off from her executive role at a health company. A franchise recruiter called her and asked, ""Do you want to work for anybody else?"" Gardner replied, ""Absolutely not. I work really hard. I want to do it for me.""She was passionate about the environment, so was drawn to Filta Environmental Kitchen Solutions. The company, which has 127 franchisees in 348 territories, cleans fryers in commercial kitchens and filters impurities from their cooking oil so it lasts longer, swaps out the oil when it's spent, and recycles oil for use in biofuels. Gardner used the money from her 401(k) to buy two territories on Long Island. Six months later, she was getting so much business that her husband quit his job to join her. Now the couple owns six territories. Here, she shares what the transition was like — and why the risk was worth it.Related: The Role and Responsibilities of a Franchisee, DefinedWhy'd you decide to cash out your 401(k)?It was terrifying. I thought: If I don't get another job that I deserve, and I can't keep padding my 401(k), then it's really not enough to retire on anyway. So why not roll the dice? I didn't want to have loans. I wanted the first year [of the franchise] to be fully paid for, so we could jump in and run — and that's what we did.How did you find Filta Environmental Kitchen Solutions?



I worked with a franchise coach. He asked what I was interested in, and I said the environment. I also looked at mobile dog grooming because I love dogs, but there are a lot of mobile dog groomers out there, and nobody was doing this oil filtering on Long Island.How does it help the environment to filter oil from a restaurant's fryers?Instead of just dumping oil and getting rid of it, we're saving so many things. We're saving on the plastic jugs. On fertilizer. On all the farming of all the soybeans. We take oil out of the fryers to be processed into biofuel, so it can be used in planes and things like that. It's double revenue and double environmental impact.How hard is the work? We're filtering all the impurities out of the oil, and we're vacuuming all the crumbs and junk out of the bottom of the fryers, so you have more consistent quality for cooking for a longer time. It is hard work. It's not for the faint of heart. The equipment is heavy, and you're moving this equipment in and out of places using loading docks. But my husband tells all the guys who work for us that his 55-year-old wife is outworking them right now.Related: He Opened a Pizza Restaurant to Serve the Native American Community. It Was So Successful He's Opening 20 More.Who are your clients?During the pandemic, we went after the big guys because everything else was shut down. Filta has contracts with companies that run arenas and stadiums: UBS Arena, Citifield, Hofstra University. Once those guys get to know you, and they know you're here, the sale isn't as hard as you think. You just have to get the right person to talk to.Do you plan to keep the focus solely on those larger clients?We're trying to build out more of the smaller businesses now. If something happens to one thing, you want to have yourself covered with something else. If I'm going after smaller accounts, they're probably right near my bigger accounts, so it just makes the route more profitable.

  Her 'Crude Prototype' and $50 Craigslist Purchase Launched a Side Hustle That Hit $1 Million in Sales — Now the Business Generates Up to $20 Million a Year

      Key Takeaways    



        Rowley recognized a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear — like wraps. 
      


        She bought a few thousand dollars worth of fabric and a used serger and opened an Etsy shop, then got to work. 
      


        After her husband joined the company, they hired their first employee, and sales exploded — to $1 million. 
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elle Rowley, founder of Solly Baby, a company that produces sustainably sourced baby wraps made of 100% certified TENCEL Modal and other baby gear. In 2023, Rowley stepped away from her day-to-day role (she now serves the brand as a strategic advisor and is on the board), and the company welcomed Nicole Newhouse as CEO to lead the next stage of Solly Baby's growth.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly Baby. Elle Rowley.When did you start Solly Baby as a side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?



After having my first baby in 2009, I was surprised to find a surge of creative inspiration that I had never known before having kids. My husband was still in school, and I was hungry to start something to supplement our meager student income. By the time I was pregnant with our second child in 2011, the online world was fertile ground for mothers looking to start a side hustle from home. I tried a few different things, but I intuitively knew that there was a gap in the market when it came to aesthetically pleasing baby gear, so I was pretty focused on that space throughout my pregnancy.I loved wearing my first baby, and I'd heard that wraps were the most comfortable way to wear an infant, so being industrious and broke, I made two wraps out of cheap jersey knit fabric — one for me and one for a friend who was also pregnant. While my crude prototype was far from what the product became, I could see the potential for this long piece of fabric to actually be a fashion accessory for the wearer rather than ""baby gear."" What really sealed it, though, was the first time I timidly ventured out holding my toddler's hand and carrying my baby wrapped on my chest. Before we left the front porch, he was asleep and breathing deeply on my chest. The increase in confidence that I felt with each step was palpable. I felt liberated, and at the same time, I'd never felt more connected to my baby. I knew I was on to something.


What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground?I found a fabric supplier in the fabric district of Los Angeles, purchased a few thousand dollars worth of fabric (thanks to credit cards and a loan from my in-laws), bought a used serger on Craigslist for $50 and opened an Etsy shop. Then, I got to work mostly when my babies were sleeping. I turned our house into a factory to make the first 50 wraps. I signed up for every local handmade market that I could find, which didn't garner great sales results, but the feedback I received from people in real life was invaluable. Lastly, in a decision that felt reckless at the time because of the cost, I hired my favorite photographer to take photos of me wearing my son. I had a nice camera and could have ""made-do"" on my own, but I knew that having beautiful images would help compensate for the many other areas where the brand was weak.Image Credit: Courtesy of Solly BabyWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building the business, and how did you navigate them?


Growth is expensive: I had no capital other than the $4,000 loan for fabric, and finance is not my area of expertise, so I knew I would need a very cash flow-positive business model. In the first three years, it was very challenging to finance our growth, but I can see what a gift it was now to have that constraint. Because we had no factoring terms with our suppliers or credit lines, we'd have to pay a hefty deposit on our production when we submitted the purchase order. Then, we'd pay the remainder of the balance upon completion. This made growth slow, and we were constantly underselling. As demand for the product grew, we started placing everything on preorder on our website, which gave us enough to pay for the order. This made it so our customers were essentially funding our growth.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the business bring in at that point?Sales had been growing year over year in 2013, but we were still only grossing a few hundred thousand dollars a year and taking home less than $100,000. Daily sales were still very inconsistent, which made it difficult to have a lot of confidence in hiring employees or even believing that this was anything more than a side hustle. I was hitting a wall of exhaustion when my husband and I made the leap of faith to bring him into Solly Baby with me. He'd finished school and was working with another startup, but we both felt his time would be better spent if we focused our efforts together. This shift immediately led to new growth and vision. His help also freed me up to work more on the business rather than in the business. We then hired our first employee, Kortney, who took over customer service and fulfillment in a way that freed my husband and me up to focus on growth.Just weeks after hiring Kortney, and days before I had my third child in the spring of 2014, we released our spring collection, and the demand went through the roof. Sales went from anywhere between zero to $3,000 per day to $2,000 becoming our new daily baseline — and releases bringing in tens of thousands of dollars in a day. We hit $1 million in sales that November, and by the end of that year, we knew this was much more than a side hustle.


You've since turned your side hustle into a very successful business. What does revenue look like now?It's been amazing to experience the growth we have been able to achieve. To see this business grow from my house to an Etsy shop to reaching millions of mothers, parents and families is truly humbling. As we continued to build the team and find our footing in the market, some years, we saw revenue double year over year. Today, Solly Baby operates at $10 to 20 million in annual revenue.What's your favorite part about running Solly Baby? As a mother of four, connecting with, encouraging and providing products for postpartum mothers during a very transformational time of life has always been life-giving work for me. It will never get old to meet a mother or father who says, ""Your wraps changed my relationship with my baby."" Knowing that our products have the power to change the trajectory of a parent-child relationship is deeply rewarding.


Developing company culture and ethos was also very rewarding. I made our company motto ""small things with great love"" several years ago because I hold a deep belief that small things done thoughtfully create the biggest and best things. This is relevant to growing a business and equally relevant to raising children. Seeing this adopted and trickle down into every part of the company as CEO felt very meaningful.What does your routine look like these days? Are there any helpful habits you'd recommend to other entrepreneurs?Keeping a daily routine is my best advice. I am a big believer in getting up before your kids (unless you have an infant — then sleep as much as you can!), exercising, getting ready for the day and taking at least 30 minutes for spiritual or meditative practice.It was easy in the early days to completely neglect myself to meet the needs of my family and the business, but I strongly believe that we would've grown faster and with more intention had I taken better care of myself from the beginning. I was running on empty all of the time, and it just about broke me in the first two years. What's more is that the business was not stronger because of my ""sacrifices."" I became very depressed and anxious and finally shared this with my husband. We made a self-care plan together, and everything quickly improved in my life, personally and professionally.


What's your best advice for others hoping to start a successful business of their own? We're often encouraged to ""think big"" when it comes to business, but sometimes, thinking ""small"" is the perfect way to begin — mainly because it will get you to begin. I don't think I would have had the confidence to start a multi-million dollar, global company at the age of 25, but I didn't need to. I just needed enough confidence to make the first 50 wraps to help pay the rent and a sincere desire to bring mothers and babies closer through the product. That was all I needed to get the ball rolling, and then my confidence and vision expanded with the company. We kind of grew up together, Solly Baby and me.This WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR® article is part of our ongoing series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of running a business as a woman.

43,"I Made Over $250,000 in One Year as a Content Creator — Here's Why I'll Never Rely on It as My Main Income","Mar 15, 2024",Andrea Casanova,https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-i-made-250000-in-one-year-as-a-content-creator/470849,"
Since 2016, I've built a career by strategizing and producing content for creators, brands and influential figures alike. Back then, breaking into this industry carried a weighty price tag, both financially and creatively. In those early days, aspiring to become an influencer felt like striving for a rarefied form of celebrity.The learning curve was steep, and success demanded a meticulous curation of content. It was an era characterized by exclusivity.Then came TikTok. Suddenly, the barriers crumbled, and the entry point became accessible to all. With just a smartphone and an idea, anyone could step into the spotlight and share their creativity with the world. From overnight 'It Girls' to ordinary individuals transitioning from 9-5 jobs to full-time creators, TikTok has revolutionized how people achieve financial independence.



Personally, I found myself swept up in this wave of democratization, seizing the opportunity to share my knowledge and insights on marketing and entrepreneurship through my own content as ""latinapreneur"" and leveraging the platform to promote my services as a marketing strategist.Not only was I able to quickly scale my service-based business, but I also started working with some of my favorite brands. In 2023, I made over $250,000 in branded content, solidifying my position as a successful content creator with the ability to go full-time if I wanted.


However, this spontaneous rise to fame and fortune is not a universal experience for every content creator. In fact, even for seasoned creators, there's usually a drought season, with brand deals falling through and algorithm changes limiting content reach. I know the struggle all too well.Related: I Made $389,822 In One Year On YouTube. Here's How I Did ItOne moment, you're riding the virality wave, and the next, you're refreshing your email, hoping that a brand rep is not actually ghosting you. The truth is, in this realm, nothing is guaranteed. Deals can fall through, campaigns can be canceled, and budgets can dry up in an instant.So, to creatorpreneurs who are tired of being at the mercy of quarterly marketing budgets and enduring 90-days+ payment terms, here's a roadmap for transitioning from working with brands to becoming the brand.


1. Redefine your identityThe way you speak about yourself will dictate the opportunities you get. Think beyond your current role and envision where you want to be. Start branding yourself accordingly, making your platform an added advantage rather than the sole focus.Related: How to Create Consistent Branding That Sticks2. Mobilize your audienceWhile you might be tired of hearing about it, building an email list is crucial for owning your audience. If emails aren't your thing, consider communities like WhatsApp or Discord. Don't wait for another potential platform ban to take action.3. Identify winning conceptsWhat content of yours has generated social buzz? What are your followers constantly asking for? These are your winning concepts. Explore how you can further develop and monetize them.


Related: 4 Ways to Leverage TikTok for Startup Growth4. Start small, scale upYou don't have to jump straight into high-ticket offers. Begin with something simple, like lead magnets or low-ticket mini-courses. The goal is to create a product with minimal investment required. I recently launched a vision board mini-course, which generated over $8,000 in the first month. It took just four hours from ideation to publishing, including batching content for promotion.5. Expand your horizonsWhile creators often focus on diversifying content types and pivoting to long-form, I believe the conversation about diversification should be broader. For instance, I recently took on a role at an entertainment company as an executive and creative mind. This move has opened up opportunities for professional growth in a whole new arena.The creator economy may be booming, but questions linger about its long-term sustainability and fair compensation for influencers and content creators.


Most content seems to be positioning brand partnerships as this abundant and definitive marker of success in the creator economy. However, while brand partnerships can be lucrative and valuable, they are just one piece of the larger puzzle.It's time to broaden the conversation and recognize the multitude of pathways to success for content creators, emphasizing the importance of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship beyond traditional brand collaborations.

44,Do Children Need to Go Out of State for the Real College Experience?,"Mar 11, 2024",Mary Banks,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/do-children-need-to-go-out-of-state-for-the-real-college/470434,"
College is an unforgettable time for most of us — it's where we come into our own, begin to carve unique paths and form lasting memories and relationships. Many adults fondly reminisce about their college years, cherishing the freedom, independence, reinvention and fun.But is this experience reserved for those who attend out-of-state schools? Must it begin in a dorm room far away, or can children have the same transformative experience by attending an in-state college or even living at home? As a former admissions officer who has observed both perspectives, I can confidently say that children can enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime experience no matter how far they are from home. Let's explore this further.Related: What I Learned as a First-Generation College Student



Redefining the college experienceLet's first define the ""real college experience."" It encompasses three fundamental components: students living autonomously, forming new connections beyond childhood bonds and navigating their independence through self-directed decision-making and learning from mistakes. When we consider these elements, it becomes obvious that students can experience that special transformative college journey without putting hundreds of miles between them and their parents. In fact, sometimes students still rely on their parents even when separated by hundreds of miles, which I can personally attest to. As a college student, I would often bring my laundry home to wash all the way from Boston to Connecticut. On the other hand, even a two-mile distance can provide that necessary sense of freedom and autonomy.As I've often advised students, the campus environment is a novel experience for everyone, regardless of their college. The sense of wonder and excitement is palpable for any student taking their first steps onto campus. They are surrounded by peers from diverse backgrounds, each with their own stories, perspectives and aspirations. The campus is a hub of activity, with countless clubs, organizations and events catering to various interests. Whether it's joining a sports team, participating in a cultural festival or volunteering for a cause, the campus is always abuzz, and students have many ways to get involved.


Further, it's also a place of growth and self-discovery. Away from the familiarity of home and without their parents, students are pushed outside of their comfort zones and encouraged to take risks, try new things and challenge themselves. This process of self-exploration and personal development is an integral part of the college experience and isn't exclusive to out-of-state students.Related: 5 Reasons College Is Worth It for EntrepreneursThe advantages of staying close to homeStaying closer to home for college has several advantages. A major benefit to attending an in-state college is the cost. Tuition costs jump from a few thousand to $40,000 when attending an out-of-state school. This is especially important considering the ""freshman year flounder,"" where some students get caught up in the excitement of newfound freedom. They may not take academics as seriously and need to retake courses, prolonging their education by a year or so and, thus, increasing costs for their families. On the other hand, with in-state tuition, students can take advantage of lower costs during their first couple of years of college and then transfer to an out-of-state school to continue living the college dream for their final years.Staying closer to home also allows for a smoother transition into the responsibilities and challenges of college life. This can be particularly valuable for those who are introverted or haven't had extensive experience living independently. Encouraging your child to become independent and leave comfort behind is crucial, but pushing them to dive headfirst into living alone in a different state might be too much too soon. Attending a school closer to home will allow them to gradually step out of their comfort zone at their own pace, with the emotional support of family nearby when they feel overwhelmed. Moreover, while out-of-state Ivy League schools can offer more global degrees, students hoping to begin their careers in their home base may find it easier to network and access relevant career opportunities by attending an in-state college. To decide which option is best for your child and feasible for you financially, It's important to have these conversations seriously and first understand your child's needs and goals.Related: Should Your Entrepreneurial Child Go to College?


Setting boundaries: The key to the college experienceOn a final note, regardless of whether your child moves thousands of miles away or stays at home, the only way for them to truly have that explorative college experience is if you respect their independence and set healthy boundaries. While it can be challenging to watch them leave the nest, giving them the freedom to fully embrace this part of their lives is essential for their growth. It's important to allow them to make their own mistakes while letting them know you're there to support them from a distance, even if they're just in the next room. Create this distance by avoiding micromanaging their decisions and resisting the urge to constantly check in on them. Trust your child to navigate their college experience and discover their true potential as independent, emerging adults.

        I own consulting agency Juntero Design, which began as a side hustle.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chisom Okwulehie, who started consulting agency Juntero as a side hustle when she was an employee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The piece has been edited for length and clarity. In 2017, I started working at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where I design and manage infrastructure projects. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, I'd had my first child and was told we wouldn't receive a merit-based pay increase at work, so I wanted to find ways to supplement my income. My father always told me and my siblings that if your spouse dies, you have to be able to cover the mortgage and support your family. I'm a big advocate for diversified income.So, I started Juntero as a side hustle with my husband. Now, it's a corporation that we co-own, split into two subsidiary companies or studios: Juntero Design and Juntero Technology. My husband owns Juntero Technology; I own Juntero Design. Today, Juntero is a full-fledged design and technology business, but it all started with me taking on small projects on different platforms and charging as little as $20.



Back then, I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials to prepare and experimented with my different talents — web design, photo editing, graphic design, architecture design and interior design. People gravitated towards my architecture and interior design services. Initially, I kept my prices low to build a portfolio and accumulate strong testimonials. That credibility is the greatest currency and helped me increase my visibility; for every 10 pieces of positive feedback, I'd raise my hourly rate by $20. Eventually, I learned not to trade my time for money and switched to fixed rates.Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.' Now the Business Brings in More Than $1 Million a Month — and Boasts Celebrity Fans.


I made about $55,000 that year, and over $200,000 the next. Then, in 2023, I exceeded $400,000.Then, near the end of 2021, I realized that I couldn't help as many clients as I wanted, so I had to put my ego aside and trust other people. I started hiring other designers on a project-based model. They're not employees; they're contractors. So, since 2022, I've outsourced more than 90% of the work. That helped me scale the business even more. I made about $55,000 that year and over $200,000 the next. Then, in 2023, I exceeded $400,000.At Port Authority, my salary is $125,000. The net profits at Juntero alone are higher than my 9-5 salary, but I plan to stay at Port Authority. Some people think I'm crazy, but I'm on a public student loan forgiveness program and have three years left. Also, I learn so much from my colleagues' expertise.Now that I'm not on the production side of Juntero, I spend more time on marketing and client management. We have two payment structures: a one-time payment model and a subscription-based model. I've spent a lot of time marketing the subscription model. It's an idea that came to me last year. One of my major clients is a developer, so with the subscription model, she can pay the monthly rate and access our services for a range of tasks.


Related: How to Go From Side Hustle to 7-Figure Business and Beyond, According to 3 Women Who Did ItA marketer could hire a designer at $100,000 a year or enroll with my service and see even more output. So it's a huge cost savings.I'm very passionate about the subscription model because it's a game changer: It's allowing companies that don't have creative teams to enroll in a membership program and access my creative team for a consistent flow of deliverables, whether it be drawings or 3D models. And it helps these businesses scale, too. One of my clients uses my renderings to consistently sell multimillion-dollar homes over the asking price. With the subscription model, these companies can have five people doing the work for the salary of one; for instance, a marketer could hire a designer at $100,000 a year or enroll with my service and see even more output. So it's a huge cost savings.Related: I Turned My Side Hustle Into a Passive Income Stream That's Earned More Than $1 Million — But Making Money Isn't Even the Best Part

46,6 Ways I've Achieved a Healthy Work-Life Balance as a Business Owner,"Mar 11, 2024",Kartik Jobanputra,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-master-work-life-harmony-with-these-simple-steps/469893,"
Collaboration is a powerful tool that has become increasingly essential in the modern business world. Working together with others can help drive growth, innovation, and success. My journey with collaboration caused me to discover some hacks that have improved my work-life balance.This article will explore the importance of these hacks and provide some tips for re-prioritizing your work-life relationship and using it to achieve your goals.Related: Why Strong Collaborations Will Change Your Business



1. Set clear boundariesThe first step to finding balance is to set clear boundaries between your professional and personal life. When you're working, focus solely on business tasks without letting any outside influences distract you.Similarly, when you're out of the office, ensure that work doesn't infringe upon your other activities or relationships. You must understand what lines must not be crossed for both sides of your life to remain healthy and balanced.


2. Prioritize your timeWhen managing your time as an entrepreneur, it's important to prioritize the most important tasks first. This means taking some extra time during the day or week to plan what needs to be done ahead of time so that nothing is left undone or forgotten about. Doing this will help keep task-related stress at bay and give you more freedom in determining how best to divide up the rest of your day or week into a manageable schedule.Additionally, don't forget to add some non-work-related activities into your schedule, such as exercise or leisurely activities — these can help provide much-needed respite from your otherwise hectic workloads.Related: 15 of the Best Time Management and Productivity Books of All Time3. Take regular breaksIt's easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in their work and forget about taking regular breaks throughout their day. But breaks are essential for maintaining both physical and mental health — they can help reduce stress levels while providing an opportunity for creativity, too.


Try setting reminders on your phone or computer so that you take regular breaks throughout the day – this could mean stepping away from the desk for 10 minutes every hour or even going for a walk during lunchtime, if possible! Taking regular breaks will refresh your mind and body alike, helping you stay productive yet balanced over time.Related: How to Achieve A CEO Level of Focus by Breaking Habits and Taking Breaks4. Learn to say noAs an entrepreneur, it can be easy to overextend yourself by saying yes too often when asked for favors or projects outside of work hours — but learning when (and how) to say no can ultimately save considerable amounts of unnecessary stress in the long run.Don't feel guilty if you need to turn down certain requests; just politely explain why it's not possible at this particular time, perhaps offering alternative solutions depending on what may be suitable instead. By knowing when (and how) to say no without feeling guilty, entrepreneurs can find greater peace of mind while still being able to give back where needed most.


5. Schedule regular 'me time'Making sure that there is adequate 'me time' built into each week is essential – regardless if it's reading a book in silence, going out with friends, or simply enjoying a warm bath after work hours — whatever activity works best for giving yourself some much-needed rest. Having this type of downtime allows entrepreneurs ample opportunity to recharge their batteries before returning to business mode — allowing them to manage better stress levels associated with being constantly busy with numerous tasks at hand.6. Don't neglect your health and well-beingLastly - one key area that entrepreneurs needn't forget about balancing is their health & well-being; don't neglect to eat nutritious food regularly during working hours nor avoid exercise altogether either — these are paramount needs necessary for keeping one's energy levels high while reducing any risks associated from sitting down all day — thus ensuring both physical & mental well-being remains balanced over longer periods.ConclusionManaging a successful career and a satisfying lifestyle outside of work can be difficult but achievable, no matter what stage in business development one might find themselves at now.The key lies in understanding where our limits lie and setting clear boundaries between our personal life and professional obligations accordingly—along with scheduling sufficient 'me' time each week where necessary. Following such guidelines helps ensure balance remains intact over extended periods while promoting productivity and achieving success simultaneously, too.

More than half of Gen Zers and millennials have a side hustle, and 80% of them say they need the extra cash due to the state of the economy, according to a recent survey from LendingTree. From driving for rideshare services to teaching courses online, operating cotton candy vending machines, turning your backyard into a dog park, and so much more, there's something for everyone hoping to diversify their income streams — and anyone who might want to launch into full-time entrepreneurship, too.Sometimes, successful side hustlers grow their earnings to the point where they outpace the salaries from their full-time jobs, and it only makes sense to go all in on their new venture. But even people whose side gigs see less initial return might have an entrepreneurial spirit and clear vision that motivates them to commit in full, and with the right strategy and mindset, those businesses can also become highly profitable, hitting six- or even seven-figure months.Below are three women who did just that: Katherine Watercutter, founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge; Julie Berninger, co-founder of e-printables curriculum Gold City Ventures; and Danielle Cohen-Shohet, founder and CEO of booking and payments platform GlossGenius. Their journeys and areas of expertise are different, but they all know what it takes to go from a side hustle — maybe lucrative, maybe not — to a thriving multimillion-dollar business.



Related: 44 Side Hustle Ideas to Make Extra Money in 2023Here are their stories and best advice for business success:


Katherine Watercutter: Gold HingeKatherine Watercutter is the founder and CEO of activewear brand Gold Hinge. When Watercutter was 23 and worked as a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana, she started the business as a side hustle. Lack of funding proved a major hurdle in the beginning, but today, Gold Hinge counts celebrities including Kristin Cavallari and Kaitlyn Bristowe among its fans. The brand also went viral during TikTok's ""RushTok"" trend, garnering 40 million hashtag impressions and sales in the multi-millions.Watercutter's advice: ""My advice may sound as cheesy as it gets, but don't give up. People in this day and age are impatient and sometimes quick to give up when they feel like they keep failing. There were a few times when I thought I hit 'rock bottom' and exhausted all options, but I found a way around it. I felt like I was failing consistently for three years, and I know many would have given up by then, but business is all about problem-solving.""Related: At 23, She Started a Side Hustle for 'Quick Money.'

Berninger worked as a project manager for large tech companies and planned to be in the industry long term, but the ""financial independence, retire early"" (FIRE) movement inspired her to start a side hustle. She opened an Etsy shop focused on the bachelorette party niche, then co-founded the online course business that teaches other entrepreneurs how to find success on the platform. She quit her 9-5 in 2021 when the income from her ventures replaced her salary.


Berninger's advice: ""Don't start a business by yourself! Pick a business partner and scale faster! Also, don't waste time trying to piece information together on YouTube. Pay for a step-by-step program or a business consultant because your time is valuable.""Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a MonthDanielle Cohen-Shohet: GlossGeniusDanielle Cohen-Shohet is the CEO and founder of GlossGenius, an all-in-one booking, payments and point-of-sale solution that helps beauty and wellness professionals drive bookings and grow their business. In college, Cohen-Shohet did freelance makeup out of her dorm room, and she and her twin sister also collaborated on a digital receipts payments venture. Ultimately, she'd pull from those experiences to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses — and build a software company worth over $510 million in the process.Cohen-Shohet's advice: ""Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And, importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.""

Katherine Watercutter.What was your day job when you started your side hustle, and why were you interested in entrepreneurship?



I was a sales representative for a distribution company working with kitchen and bath designers around Indiana (I studied interior architecture and design). I have always been an entrepreneur since I was young; you have to have that as a part of you to be willing to take risks.When did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?


I got the idea for it in 2018 and started it in January 2019. There really was no inspiration — I thought it could make me quick money. But I was wrong about that.Related: He 'Accidentally Discovered' a Semi-Passive Side Hustle in College — Now He's on Track to Make More Than $500,000 This YearWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I started a Shopify store and created a website and an Instagram.What were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?One of the biggest challenges early on was cash flow. I didn't receive funding from outside investors and started with very little to invest. So there were a few times where I almost had to close the doors because of cash flow. It taught me a very valuable lesson early on because businesses often fail the first year when they run out of money. I navigated that by getting a line of credit from the bank and a business credit card, which helped with funds, but I also almost maxed those out. It took a lot of discipline, learning and watching the numbers to navigate this challenge until I saw more consistent growth and revenue.How long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?The side hustle didn't earn anything. It wasn't until a few years into making it my full-time job, dedicating 80-90 hours a week, that I actually started making money, and I didn't pay myself until about 2021. It is hard to say how long it took for consistent revenue because it wasn't until the spring or summer of 2020 that revenue took off — but later that year, it dropped again. It is safe to say that 2021 was the year that revenue was actually ""consistent"" enough to feel safe where debt was paid off, and things were headed in the right direction. So that would be a total of about three years (two years all-in on my business).

50,Why Middle Managers Are a Company's Hidden Superpower,"Mar 6, 2024",Sam Rockwell,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-middle-managers-are-secretly-the-heart-of-a-company/469682,"
When I set out to study organizational identity and the role that organizational leaders play in creating and reinforcing that identity, I expected to uncover some surprising results. Even then, I did not expect what I learned from Ervis Dinkel, a director in a financial management firm. She described her role in middle management as that of the translator — adding that middle managers are responsible for listening and communicating expertly all the way up and down the organization.This descriptor struck me because I have worked with many translators in my decades of nonprofit and consulting work worldwide. As I thought more, I realized that ""translator"" is a perfect term for middle managers' role in propagating organizational identity. Let me explain.Translation begins with in-depth listening and then involves converting the original message into words and a delivery that another party will understand. This skill requires constant code-switching and cross-cultural sensitivity because communication needs to be bidirectional and continuous for shared understanding to result. This is no small feat.



Related: Why We Should Be Talking About Organizational Identity and Not Just Company CultureThe same is true for middle managers, who serve as conduits between upper and frontline management. Like translators working at the borders of two or more cultures and languages, middle managers work at the borders of two distinct subcultures and languages within the organization.


As articulated by Robert L. Katz, a strategy consultant who had served on Dartmouth, Harvard and Stanford faculties, upper management is concerned with conceptual and strategic matters, slightly less with interpersonal concerns, and even less with the technical details of how the work is carried out.In contrast, frontline managers and individual contributors focus on technical details, with the least concern for strategic matters. Standing in the gap are the middle managers, who must have robust competencies in all three domains because they must speak the language and understand the concerns of all levels for information to flow effectively throughout the organization. It is not enough to pass down senior leader mandates and expect the frontline to implement them. Nor is it sufficient to simply report to upper management what first-level managers and individual contributors are experiencing.Related: 3 Practices for Leaders in a Polarized WorldAccording to Dinkel, an effective organizational translator requires significant mental and emotional energy. When it is done right, organizational performance is supported and enhanced. When it's not done well, communication breaks down, misunderstandings proliferate, and initiatives face an increased risk of failure.


The translation challenge can be particularly acute when it comes to matters of who the organization is and what we need to do collectively and individually.For example, these concerns usually center on the language of ""organizational identity"" at the upper levels, while ""culture"" is the terminology used more frequently at lower levels. These are not synonymous concepts: Whereas culture refers to the shared assumptions and values that culminate in habitual patterns of behavior within the organization, identity refers to those characteristics of the organization that are core, distinctive and enduring — adding up to ""who"" the organization essentially is.Related: How Business Leaders Can Foster an Innovative Work CultureBoth identity and culture are powerful, influencing each other, yet they are not the same. Thus, as translators, middle managers must understand these differences and take extra care to translate messages into the language and lifeworld of each subculture. Only then can shared understanding develop, leading to alignment among culture, identity, strategy, and tactics. In turn, the organization can act in concert as one entity.


Four tactics are helpful for carrying out the middle management translator role.1. See what they seeGerman philosopher Edmund Husserl and later phenomenologists developed the concept of the lifeworld to suggest that people perceive, make sense of, and interact with the world depending on their subjective experiences, surroundings, and interactions. It follows that senior leaders operate within different lifeworlds than do middle managers, and both of those lifeworlds are different from the lifeworlds of frontline managers and individual contributors. Middle managers must become familiar with all these lifeworlds and their differences in order to anticipate how each level may interpret organizational communications and, in turn, encode messages appropriately.2. Speak like a nativeTranslators must develop fluency in the vocabulary, idioms, and nuances of the multiple languages in which they operate. As a middle manager, you must speak the languages of senior leaders, frontline managers, and individual contributors like a native. Specifically, some concepts may not have direct equivalents across levels due to cultural and language nuances. Such differences can significantly impact the meaning of a text. Therefore, middle managers need to engage in frequent interaction and immersion at each organizational level to deeply understand the viewpoints, needs, and concerns of each group.3. Communicate whole messagesEffective translation requires communicating not only the text but also the tone, emotion and subtle cues to convey the intended meaning. In this way, middle management translators convey the spirit, meaning, and content of what is most important to each party. Without whole messages, the inspiration behind senior leaders' vision may fall flat, or conversely, the dire technical challenges experienced by the frontline may get lost during upward communication.


4. Navigate your biasesPersonal bias is inevitable; therefore, be mindful of it and control it. Depending on your personality and predispositions, you may find yourself oriented toward shepherding and translating what is happening at the top to your direct reports. Alternately, you may be more naturally drawn toward bringing direct reports' perspectives to senior leadership strategy sessions. It is not uncommon to feel drawn in one direction and fatigued moving in the other direction. Be aware of these tendencies and make time for self-care so that you have the energy to navigate up and down. Finally, be intentional about spending equal time and attention translating in both directions because both are essential to the healthy and aligned functioning of the organization.

51,Make Money Doing What You Love — 10 Key Tips on Monetizing Your Passion,"Mar 5, 2024",Billy Carson,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/make-money-doing-what-you-love-how-to-monetize-your/470088,"
In a world where the pursuit of passion has become synonymous with living a fulfilling life, many find themselves at a crossroads, unsure of what truly ignites their inner fire. Finding your passion isn't just about discovering a hobby or a career path; it's about uncovering what makes you feel alive, gives your life purpose and aligns with your authentic self.This journey of discovery can be transformative, leading not only to personal fulfillment but also to potential career satisfaction and happiness. Here's how you can embark on this journey and find your passion in life.Related: 5 Leaders Share 5 Ways to Find Your Passion



Discovering your true passionReflect on what you love:Start by reflecting on activities, topics or causes that you love or have always been drawn to. Think about the times you've felt most alive or lost track of time because you were so engrossed in an activity. These moments can offer clues to your passions. Don't limit yourself to conventional ideas of what a passion should be. Your passion could be anything from painting to solving complex mathematical problems.


Explore new interests:Exploration is key to uncovering your passion. Try new activities, enroll in different classes, read books outside your usual interests, and step outside your comfort zone. This process of exploration can help you discover hidden talents or interests you never knew you had. Remember, it's okay to try something and decide it's not for you; each experience brings you closer to finding what truly excites you.Identify your values:Your passion is often closely tied to your core values and what you find meaningful in life. Identifying these values can help you pinpoint areas that are likely to hold your passion. For example, if you value helping others, you might find passion in teaching, counseling or volunteering. Make a list of your top values, and consider activities that align with them.


Seek feedback:Sometimes, others can see our strengths and interests more clearly than we can. Ask friends, family and colleagues what they think you're good at or what they could see you doing. Their observations can provide valuable insights and help you see patterns or interests you might have overlooked.Look for patterns:Reflect on your past experiences, and look for patterns in the activities you've enjoyed or excelled at. These patterns can be indicators of your passion. For example, if you've always enjoyed organizing events and bringing people together, your passion might lie in community building or event planning.


Embrace the journey:Finding your passion is a journey, not a destination. It requires patience, curiosity and an open mind. Be willing to experiment, fail and learn from your experiences. Each step on this journey is an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.Consider professional help:If you're struggling to find your passion, consider seeking the help of a career counselor or life coach. These professionals can offer guidance, tools and strategies to help you identify your interests, values and potential career paths.


Combine your skills and interests:Your passion might not be a single activity or field. Many people find their passion at the intersection of various interests and skills. Think about how you can combine different aspects of your interests and skills to create a unique niche or career path for yourself.Set realistic goals:Once you have an idea of what your passion might be, set small, achievable goals to pursue it further. Whether it's taking a course, starting a side project or dedicating time each week to practice, these goals can help you make steady progress towards integrating your passion into your life.


Stay flexible:Your passion can evolve over time, and what excites you today might change in the future. Stay open to this evolution and be willing to adapt. The key is to remain true to yourself and pursue what makes you feel fulfilled at any given time.Finding your passion is a deeply personal and rewarding journey that can enhance your sense of purpose and joy in life. By exploring your interests, values and experiences, you can uncover what truly makes you tick and find ways to incorporate that passion into your daily life.Remember, the pursuit of passion is not a one-size-fits-all path but a unique adventure that is yours to explore. Embrace the journey with an open heart and mind, and let your passion lead you to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.


Related: How to Realistically Make Money From Your PassionUnlocking wealth: 10 tips on monetizing your passionIn today's dynamic world, pursuing your passion is no longer just a lofty dream; it's a viable path to financial success. With the advent of the digital age, opportunities to monetize what you love doing have multiplied, enabling many to turn their hobbies into profitable ventures. Here are ten strategic tips to help you navigate the journey of making money from your passion.1. Identify your nicheThe first step in monetizing your passion is to clearly identify your niche. A niche is a specific segment of a market that you can serve better than others. The more specific your niche, the less competition you will face, and the more likely you are to stand out to a dedicated customer base. For instance, instead of just ""cooking,"" you could specialize in ""gluten-free baking for busy parents."" This specificity can make your offering more attractive.


2. Build a strong brandYour brand is not just your logo or your website; it's the total experience customers have with your business. It includes your story, your values and the emotions people associate with your work. Building a strong, authentic brand around your passion can create a loyal community of customers and advocates. Share your journey, challenges and successes to connect with your audience on a personal level.3. Create a business planEven the most passionate pursuits need a solid business plan. Your plan should outline your business model, market analysis, financial projections and marketing strategies. It doesn't have to be overly complicated, but it should give you a clear roadmap of how you intend to make money from your passion. This step can also help you identify potential challenges and opportunities for growth.


4. Leverage social mediaSocial media is a powerful tool for reaching and engaging with your target audience. Platforms like Instagram, YouTube and Pinterest are particularly effective for visual and creative fields, while LinkedIn and X can be great for more professional and service-oriented passions. Share valuable content that showcases your expertise, tells your story and builds your community.5. Diversify your income streamsRelying on a single income stream can be risky, especially in the early stages of your business. Look for ways to diversify your income. This could mean selling products, offering services, creating online courses or even affiliate marketing. For example, if you're passionate about photography, you could sell prints, offer photography workshops and create a photography course.


6. Offer exceptional valueTo stand out in a crowded market, you need to offer exceptional value to your customers. This could be through the quality of your products, the uniqueness of your services or the depth of your knowledge. Always aim to exceed expectations and provide something that people can't get anywhere else.7. Network and collaborateNetworking and collaboration can open up new opportunities to monetize your passion. Attend industry events, join online communities, and connect with other professionals in your field. Collaborations can also help you reach a wider audience, whether it's through guest blogging, social media takeovers or co-creating products.


8. Learn and adaptThe path to monetizing your passion is rarely a straight line. Be prepared to learn from your experiences, listen to feedback and adapt your strategies as needed. Stay updated with the latest trends in your industry, and don't be afraid to pivot your business model if necessary.9. Focus on quality customer serviceExcellent customer service can differentiate your business and turn customers into repeat buyers and brand advocates. Be responsive, solve problems quickly, and always strive to provide a positive experience. Personal touches, such as handwritten thank-you notes or personalized recommendations, can make a big difference.10. Stay passionate and persistentFinally, the most important tip is to stay passionate and persistent. Turning your passion into a profitable venture requires hard work, dedication and resilience. There will be challenges and setbacks, but it's your passion that will keep you going. Remember why you started, and don't lose sight of your love for what you do.Related: How to Turn Your Passion Into Your Dream JobMonetizing your passion is not just about making money; it's about creating a fulfilling life where work doesn't feel like work. By following these ten tips, you can take practical steps toward turning your passion into a sustainable income source. Remember, the journey of monetizing your passion is as rewarding as the destination. Embrace the process, learn from every experience, and celebrate your progress. Do not chase the money. Instead, chase your passion and the side effect will be money in your bank account because it only appears as the direct result of an energy exchange. Here's to turning your passion into your paycheck!

52,This Workplace Expert's 'Brainwashing'-Esque Technique Will Help You Get the Raise You Deserve,"Mar 5, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/4-expert-backed-tips-to-negotiate-a-raise-or-promotion/470611,"
It can be nerve-wracking to ask for a raise or promotion. In fact, most people (55%) won't even start the conversation because they're afraid they won't know what to say (16%) or are worried they'll appear greedy (15%), according to a survey from Reed Recruitment. For many, another uncomfortable feeling accompanies those fears: awkwardness.The definition of the word might vary depending on who you ask, but when it comes to negotiations in the workplace, it can be described as ""the emotion that we feel when the person we believe ourselves to be is momentarily at odds or facing a gap with the person who is on display,"" Henna Pryor, workplace-performance expert and author of Good Awkward: How to Embrace the Embarrassing and Celebrate the Cringe to Become the Bravest You, says.In other words, when you're negotiating for the raise you deserve and don't get the response you hope for (perhaps your manager gives you a quizzical look instead), your identity at that moment doesn't align with the person you perceive yourself to be — one who's worthy of a pay bump or promotion, Pryor explains.



Before becoming an executive coach and speaker, Pryor spent 14 years in executive search and staffing, so these types of conversations have been her ""lifeblood"" for two decades. She knows that awkwardness can be inherent in such negotiations but says it's only ""bad"" if it prevents someone from going after what they want. Otherwise, it's ""good;"" with strategic preparation, it gets people one step closer to their goals.Related: 5 Important Lessons 'Shark Tank' Teaches Us About Negotiation


Entrepreneur sat down with Pryor to learn more about how to harness the power of ""good awkward"" in make-or-break workplace conversations, from a ""brainwashing""-adjacent method that helps get everyone on the same page to a rehearsal strategy that women might find particularly useful ahead of Equal Pay Day (in 2022, American women earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men).""I jokingly say in some of my keynotes, 'Don't go tell your friends that Henna taught you how to brainwash.'""First, when you're going into a negotiation for a raise or promotion, it's important not to think it will be ""like a game of ping-pong,"" where there will be a quick back-and-forth as you feel each other out and ""see how it goes."" Instead, it's strategic to keep the conversation ""focused on a place of agreement,"" Pryor says. For instance, you might ask your manager if they agree that your contributions for the quarter have had a positive impact on the team's performance and if there's room in the budget to reward high performers, she explains.""I jokingly say in some of my keynotes, 'Don't go tell your friends that Henna taught you how to brainwash,'"" Pryor quips, ""but this is actually how brainwashing works — slowly getting a set of agreements, of affirmations, of 'yes' questions to [make it feel like] you're on the same page.

53,Why These 5 Characteristics of Self-Reliance Will Guarantee Your Success,"Mar 5, 2024",Maha Abouelenein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/follow-these-5-characteristics-of-self-reliance-to-succeed/469983,"
Decades ago, my dad told me that relying on myself was vital for my success and personal growth. His advice is more relevant now than ever. In today's business landscape, where technology — such as OpenAI's Sora — is advancing quickly and workers across industries are being laid off, self-reliance is crucial for long-term entrepreneurial success.Throughout my career, I've practiced self-reliance (whether I knew it at each moment or not). I've found that entrepreneurs who do not have a self-reliant mindset are more likely to fail because they struggle to make tough decisions, solve problems, or take necessary risks for success. Self-reliance empowers you to adapt swiftly to shifting market dynamics and reduces your dependence on external factors. You are driven to innovate, relying on your ingenuity and resourcefulness to develop solutions.When I say self-reliance, I don't mean going at it alone; it's about knowing when to seek help and where to find it. Self-reliance involves looking inward for answers and reaching outward for support and ideas. As a self-reliant entrepreneur, you think big and bold without waiting for others to solve problems for you.



There are five inherent characteristics of self-reliance that entrepreneurs should embrace for success:1. Take initiative and don't be afraid to innovateEntrepreneurs benefit from self-reliance by taking initiative and innovating. This mindset of self-reliance allows them to turn ideas into reality, identify opportunities, and create solutions independently. In challenging situations, a self-reliant entrepreneur explores alternative plans to keep the business moving.


For instance, when faced with financial challenges in my company, I cut non-essential expenses. Then I innovated by expanding our offerings to a wider clientele through online workshops. This initiative, born out of self-reliance, not only added value but also generated a new and consistent revenue stream without increasing prices or overhead. Entrepreneurs' ability to innovate and take initiative is fundamental to self-reliance.Moreover, taking the initiative as an entrepreneur is crucial for staying ahead of the competition. Entrepreneurs can carve out their niche and distinguish themselves from competitors by actively seeking opportunities and proactively addressing challenges.Whether launching a new product, entering a new market, or exploring new technologies, entrepreneurs can find growth and success when they take the initiative.2. Be adaptableEntrepreneurs who embrace self-reliance possess the critical qualities of adaptability and agility. Challenges are inevitable in entrepreneurship, and they require quick adaptation and adjustment. Take, for example, the transition to remote work during the pandemic. As entrepreneurs, we had to quickly figure out how to operate our businesses and network from home. Entrepreneurs who embraced adaptability and adopted new collaboration tools and strategies were successful. They sustained their business operations and discovered newfound efficiencies and flexibility that continue to benefit them.


Adaptability is crucial as entrepreneurs navigate the complexities of remote work and ""return to office"" policies. We must carefully assess the impact of returning to the office on employee morale, work-life balance, and overall productivity. Striking the right balance between remote and in-person work while addressing individual preferences and concerns is paramount for fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment.Related: Success Is the Biggest Benefit of Being Adaptable3. Trust your instincts and take accountabilityThroughout my career, I have found that a self-reliance mindset allows you to trust your judgment, instincts, and vision. Owning a business involves constant decision-making that impacts the company's trajectory – from personnel management to business relationships. As leaders, we often face high-stakes decisions that shape our success's strategic and financial direction. While data and analysis are essential, sometimes you must go with your gut feeling.Trusting your instincts means having confidence in your judgment and intuition, even when uncertain. Whether deciding which market to enter or which partner to collaborate with, you must rely on your instincts to guide you. While not every decision will be perfect, trusting your instincts can lead to innovative ideas, bold moves, and success. It enables you to make decisions that align with your company's needs, no matter the situation.


I want to point out that a vital aspect of trusting your instincts is taking accountability for your decisions. Entrepreneurs who embody self-reliance understand that they alone are responsible for the success or failure of their ventures. By holding themselves accountable, they demonstrate commitment to their goals and responsibilities and avoid reliance on external factors or excuses. This mindset fosters personal growth, drives initiative, and enables entrepreneurs to persevere in the face of challenges, ultimately enhancing the resilience and sustainability of their efforts.4. Have confidence in your abilities and leadershipThe entrepreneurial journey is often likened to a roller coaster, marked by ups and downs, requiring leadership, grit, and resilience. Entrepreneurs wear many hats and handle various responsibilities. The initial challenges of being the boss, answering questions, and providing solutions can be daunting, but working across the business fosters self-reliance, instilling confidence in one's abilities. I've learned that this confidence is crucial for earning trust from clients, stakeholders, and your team. Self-reliance is vital in making internal decisions, offering feedback, and cultivating a proactive, problem-solving culture. Moreover, the confidence derived from self-reliance aids in hiring the right people and building a winning formula based on training and trust.Related: 10 Ways to Build Your Entrepreneurial Confidence5. Seek opportunities to learn and improveIn today's world, continuous learning is essential for success. Successful entrepreneurs adopt a growth mindset, actively seeking opportunities to learn and improve. They embrace feedback and constantly search for new skills to master. For example, you may attend workshops, courses, or networking events relevant to your industry. You might also engage in mentorship or coaching programs to gain insights from seasoned professionals and learn from their experiences. I recently took a proactive approach to expand my knowledge of finance and attended a specialized course at the London Business School.


Entrepreneurs must be curious, open to learning, and willing to acquire new knowledge to stay prepared. You must view a growth mindset as taking ownership of your education and remaining open-minded about what you don't know.

54,5 Best Interview Questions to Ask Potential Employees —And What Their Answers Reveal,"Mar 5, 2024",Entrepreneur Staff,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-5-best-questions-to-ask-potential-employees/470273,"
The job interview is one of the best ways to determine if a candidate will mesh with the company's culture and add to its long-term success. Sure, they might look stellar on their resume, but a lot can be revealed when a candidate is asked pointed questions about their background and working style.Some human resource managers screen candidates, asking a few preliminary questions over the phone before bringing them in for a formal interview with managers. Others save time by turning to AI-powered platforms such as CandidateView, which allows them to ask prerecorded questions and view applicants' answers via video. Still, others skip the pre-screening process altogether and go right for person-to-person interviews out the gate.Whatever your interview process, you want to ask questions that give you a clearer view of the candidate's work ethic, values, and personality. While there are no guarantees that any candidate will be the perfect match, here are some of the best interview questions to boost your chances of finding an employee who will strengthen your workforce.



Related: Avoid Costly Hiring Mistakes With These Five Essential TipsCultural fitA good cultural fit means recruiting employees whose values and shared behaviors align with your company's. As the saying goes, fitting a square peg in a round hole is tricky. So why force it if it's not a good match?


During the interview or a video-based pre-interview, be sure to ask a few questions that dive a bit deeper into the candidate's past experience navigating other work environments.Ask: Can you tell me about a time when your workplace had a great culture? What did management do to foster that? Now, tell me about a time when the workplace was toxic? What do you think management did wrong?By posing two contracting cultural scenarios, you will better understand what the candidate believes makes a good work environment and what breeds disharmony.Management styleWhether you're hiring someone in a junior-level or management role, it's helpful to understand how they prefer to be managed. Some employees like the autonomous, hands-off approach, while others thrive with clear objectives and guidelines.


Ask: How you best like to be managed? Describe the ideal manager for your personality style.The answer will help determine if the candidate will get along with the specific manager or department. For example, if they prefer a results-based manager who doesn't care how they do their work as long as they get it done, they may not fit with someone who is more hands-on.Self-awarenessIntrospection is a vital skill for any employee because it reveals an ability to be honest about one's strengths and weaknesses—and helps them make better decisions. For example, if an employee knows they struggle with public speaking, they might improve those skills or delegate the task to another employee.Ask: If you had to weigh in on your challenges, what areas would you want to work on to improve?


The answer reveals several important things: It helps you determine if a candidate can self-reflect, and it gives you some insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Beware of the candidate who says they have no challenges. Everyone has room to improve, and people who don't think so are probably not being honest with themselves.Related: The 10 Communication Skills Every Entrepreneur Must MasterConflict resolutionUnless you're working in Barbieland, there will always be challenges in the workplace. How an employee deals with these hurdles can be the difference between harmonious conflict resolution and a train wreck. During the interview, hone in on specific challenges the candidate has encountered and what they did to resolve them.Ask: Tell me about a conflict you faced at work and how you dealt with it.


Listen for clues on how they relied on their skillset to resolve the issue. Did they take a conscientious and considerate look at the situation first? Did they manage to stay calm? Did they collaborate with others to find a solution? These are some of the C's you want to look out for.Related: Here's What Hiring Managers Should Focus On to Find Their Next Great Employee.Detail orientedEmployees who pay attention to the details tend to produce work more aligned with your needs and require less supervision and hand-holding. There's an old standby question, a classic but a goodie, that can help you determine right off the bat if they're detail-oriented.Ask: Why do you want to work for our company?


When you ask this question, you get a better understanding of how well the candidate prepped for their interview. Their answer tells you if they've researched your company and what product or service you sell. If they've done their homework, it's a good indicator that they pay attention to details.Related: Here's What to Expect in a Job Interview in Today's Job Market

It's Leap Day: the extra day tacked onto the end of February, typically every four years, to account for the Earth's full 365-day-plus rotation around the sun.And it's Thursday, which is a traditional workday for employees and entrepreneurs alike. But does your annual pay reflect the fact you've worked an additional day in the year? Well, that depends — mostly on if you're an hourly or salaried worker.Related: Leap Year: How To Utilize the Extra Day As An EntrepreneurNaturally, employees paid by the hour will be paid for every hour worked; as a result, those bonus hours worked should show up in the next paycheck. Salaried workers, on the other hand, won't necessarily see any pay adjustment.In this case, are salaried employees getting the short end of the stick? Not exactly, according to CNN Business, as many of those employees will see work hours ebb and flow week to week depending on their projects, so it might work out in the end.But it's worth noting that a 2019 Gallup poll found that 52% of full-time workers reported working more than 40 hours a week, while 39% worked at least 50 hours a week, and 18% worked at least 60.Related: Want to Be More Productive?

      Key Takeaways    



        I uploaded my ""MBA in a Day"" course on the online learning platform Udemy in 2016. 
      


        The single course has generated more than seven figures in passive income, but it's not about the money for me. 
      


        I have 72 other courses online, and I use the profits from my business to build schools.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chris Haroun, CEO and founder of Haroun Education Ventures. It has been edited and condensed for clarity. After I graduated from business school at Columbia, I worked at Goldman Sachs for five years. Then, I switched to the hedge fund industry, and Citadel hired me and relocated my family to the San Francisco Bay Area. There, I eventually switched to the venture capital sector. And I found that my happiest day at work was always the first day. And then it went downhill, and I couldn't understand why. I did fine at work, but I thought maybe I was depressed or something. But it was because I hadn't found my passion.During the years I worked at other companies, I found that during my annual review, it was always uncomfortable for my bosses because they would say something like, ""You're doing a great job. You're a top performer. Everybody loves working with you. But can you spend a little bit less time mentoring other people on other teams?"" And I always said, ""It's just who I am. I can't change the DNA of who I am."" I love helping people. So I started teaching.



Related: 4 Passive Income Ideas to Try as a Side Hustle in 2024In 2016, while I was still working in venture capital, I started teaching during the evenings in East Palo Alto. I felt alive helping those students. I loved it. Then I started to teach at a couple of Bay Area MBA universities. One Saturday, I taught a course that I called ""MBA in a Day"" through the LEMO Foundation, which serves under-resourced student-athletes. And the next day, I just threw up a camera at home and recorded myself for eight hours. Then I uploaded it to the online learning and teaching platform Udemy.


That course has sold close to 500,000 times, generating a passive income stream of seven figures in net profit after all expenses. And I continued to scale: Now, I have 72 other courses on Udemy and nearly two million students across the globe. And although this work can be relatively low-touch from a customer service perspective, the goal isn't just to make money. It's to help others. I spend a lot of time helping students, jumping on Zoom calls and answering questions.The profits from what I do go toward building schools. If you go to Project Magu, you'll see the first school that I built with one of my students in Rwanda. And with another one of my students, I'm building the second school now in Kenya, about a six-hour drive from Nairobi. It's a school for girls.Related: Anyone Can Start a Passive Income Side Hustle For Easy Money — But Only If You Know These 5 Essential Tips First.It's a great sense of purpose for me. When I was at the LEMO Foundation, the founder of that charity told me something that changed me. He said, ""You can't expect to realize your dreams in life unless you help others achieve theirs first."" So we're all here, as Tony Robbins once told me, to serve others and to help other people. And so that's what I did.


The pandemic was tragic, but it really pulled forward my vision of the future of education by at least a decade. And I think that in my lifetime, only 50 universities will make it. I think what's going to happen, ultimately, is that most will deplete their endowments, and then there'll be a Hail Mary pass to alumni to save the schools, and then people will think to themselves, Why bother going to university unless it's a great brand like a Harvard or Oxford? The system is elitist to the extent that a lot of children get into top schools because their parents went there or they donated money. Another problem is that you pay $100,000 for 20 hours of class per week, and you graduate without any skills.In my book 101 Crucial Lessons They Don't Teach You in Business School, I outline the problem with MBA schools. They don't teach you how to sell. They don't teach you how to network to get a job. They don't teach you how to manage your own money. They teach you how to manage other people's money. They don't teach you how to present. They don't teach you how to start a company. Graduate and undergraduate business programs teach you theoretical concepts that were relevant maybe last century. So I think that the sector is ripe for disruption. I think Udemy is going to be the catalyst to kind of change the industry where more people are going to learn online.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money. Subscribe to Entrepreneur+ now.What's more, everybody has something to teach. For instance, there's a woman named Teresa Greenway who's a great teacher on Udemy — and she teaches how to bake bread. And it's an amazing story: Years ago before she started teaching on Udemy, she was in an awful marriage with an abusive husband. It was terrible. And she got the courage to leave him and take her kids with her. So she was living off food stamps, and she thought to herself, What can I do to help other people? What am I passionate about? And she's passionate about baking bread. So she put up a camera at home, and she started showing people how to make bread on the platform. Again, everybody has something to teach you.

      Key Takeaways    



        In 2006, El Ghatit was working in IT when he got the idea for a sentimental telephone-based business. 
      


        A few months later, he was laid off and decided to focus on growing his side hustle. 
      


        As a side hustle, the venture earned $100,000 per year; now a full-time business, it's on track to see more than $700,000 in 2024.
      












This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Alaa El Ghatit, founder of LifeOnRecord. LifeOnRecord is a service that lets people phone in stories, memories and well wishes for someone celebrating a birthday, retirement, wedding or other special occasion. The recordings are put onto a keepsake speaker or a vinyl album.Image Credit: Courtesy of Alaa El GhatitWhen did you start LifeOnRecord as a side hustle, and what inspired it?



Back in 2006, I was working in an IT department of a large employee benefits consulting firm, managing 60 people, and I wasn't feeling fulfilled at my job. I didn't like being in meetings all day, and I wanted to get more hands-on again and work on something more meaningful, but I couldn't see a viable path to doing that where I was.I had been playing around with a telephone system in my spare time and wondered if I could create a business by having people call in and record their favorite stories and memories about a person as a way to celebrate their birthday, retirement, wedding, etc.


Related: He Started a Side Hustle in His Parents' Basement and Won Big on Richard Branson's TV Show. The Business Saw Over $650 Million in Annual Revenue Last Year.What were some of the first steps you took to get the side hustle off the ground? My mother-in-law's 65th birthday was coming up, and I thought she'd enjoy hearing from all her kids, grandkids, friends, husband, etc.So, as a trial, I set up a phone number that everyone could call and gave her the resulting recordings on a CD (remember — this was 2006). We all listened to it together on her birthday in her living room. She loved it, there were tears, and it sparked a lot of stories (18 years later, she still loves it).


I thought the idea had some traction, so I worked on it in my spare time to make it a service.A few months later, I got laid off, and I decided to take some time to try and grow the business. People started ordering, but not in the volume that allowed me to support my wife and four young kids, so after nine months, I took a job as a director of IT for a mid-size company where I could be hands-on and manage a small team.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Navigating the side hustle of LifeOnRecord presented three significant challenges. First, I got used to the security of a corporate salary with the entrepreneurial aspect of LifeOnRecord. I enjoyed both, which kept me from fully committing to LifeOnRecord. Despite the automation and minimal time LifeOnRecord required, the camaraderie of my corporate role left me hesitant to leave until 2022.


Additionally, keeping LifeOnRecord a secret from colleagues fostered an emotional barrier, making me more reserved and unable to share valuable insights across both my worlds. This secrecy persisted until the pivotal moment I decided to quit my corporate job. Surprisingly, upon revealing LifeOnRecord to the CEO, I found unexpected support rather than resistance. The company facilitated a smooth transition, allowing me to gradually shift my focus to LifeOnRecord, with the CEO even providing guidance along the way.Lastly, an early challenge involved defending LifeOnRecord's intellectual property against infringement from a multi-national corporation. Through perseverance and direct negotiation, which took over a year, I secured an agreement from them without legal intervention, and I licensed my intellectual property to them for a fair but significant licensing fee.Related: Access our best side hustle stories and make more money.

Growth was gradual, but people who used the service talked about it with others and developed into repeat buyers. Before I focused on it full-time, it brought in a little over $100,000 a year as a side hustle. With my corporate salary, it allowed us to live comfortably, fund college for my kids and go on trips.How much annual revenue is LifeOnRecord projected to see this year? For me, it is not really about the money and growth but more about me being able to provide a personal, customer-focused experience that I can be directly involved in. Having said that, last year was the first year it was a full-time venture, and it brought in about $350,000, and this year we will more than double that amount. We're always super responsive to customer questions and requests, and I don't want it to get so big that stellar customer service is no longer a priority.How have you approached scaling the company? What has really been key in helping it grow? 


Right from the start, my strategy was all about leveraging technology to scale and enhance the customer experience. Recognizing that customers wanted more control over their contributions, I developed a ""My Recordings"" portal for them to edit, organize or delete their messages. I streamlined the audio enhancement process by partnering with Dolby Labs for top-notch voice clarity and noise reduction, and I expanded contribution options beyond traditional phone calls to include six alternative methods.[While] balancing this growth with my corporate responsibilities, I was mindful not to expand too quickly, aiming to maintain a healthy equilibrium between my day job and LifeOnRecord. This balance allowed me to enjoy the perks of both my professional career and my entrepreneurial venture without overwhelming myself or the business.A key innovation was introducing vintage rotary phone rentals for wedding receptions for guests to leave messages for the wedding couple. Unlike competitors that simply rent out the phones, we integrated these pieces into our broader service ecosystem. Guests love the charm of leaving messages on these classic devices, which are then enhanced and preserved through our platform.Related: This Fun, Flexible Side Hustle Pays $35 an Hour and Gets You Into Exclusive CEO Summits, Music Festivals, and Sports EventsAs you look back over your journey with LifeOnRecord, is there anything you wish you would have done differently? There's a lingering thought that maybe I should have stepped away from the corporate world sooner to fully embrace the entrepreneurial path with LifeOnRecord. The allure of stability and a predictable income often held me back, anchoring me to a role that, while comfortable, perhaps limited the potential growth of my passion project. Yet, with every decision comes a silver lining.Staying in my corporate job perhaps longer than I should have afforded me invaluable lessons and experiences. It was in this professional setting that I honed skills that later became crucial in navigating the entrepreneurial landscape: the discipline of managing projects, the art of negotiation and the ability to lead a team.This period also served as a vital incubation phase for LifeOnRecord. It allowed me to slowly but surely build the foundation of the business, testing ideas and refining the model without the immediate pressure of having it be my sole source of income. In a way, it granted me the freedom to experiment and innovate with less risk, laying the groundwork for what LifeOnRecord would eventually become.


What are you most excited about when it comes to LifeOnRecord's future? Customers have used LifeOnRecord in innovative ways. People have used LifeOnRecord to send out audio thank yous, and brides have recorded their feelings of ""saying yes to the dress"" using LifeOnRecord, then played that recording as they walk down the aisle. I think there are many more ways to market LifeOnRecord that we can explore in the future.What's your favorite part about running your own business today? I love the impact the business has on customers. When I had a corporate job, I felt like a cog in a wheel, but with LifeOnRecord, I created a way for people to make a connection with others. I'm especially grateful when people buy it and record messages for someone with a terminal illness. They say it's one of the few things they can do to show how loved the person is.Beyond that, I like the lifestyle flexibility and not needing to be accountable to anyone other than our customers. I love being identified with it and the excitement that other people have when I share what I do.

61,The CEO of Catholic Prayer and Meditation App Hallow Says Founders Need to Be Part of Something Bigger Than Themselves,"Feb 26, 2024",William Salvi,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/hallow-ceo-says-founders-need-to-be-part-of-something/470048,"
Hallow is the number one Catholic prayer and meditation app in the world with over 12 million downloads. And after a surge in downloads following its Super Bowl ad, it took the top spot on Apple's App Store across all apps.The company has raised a total of $105 million to date, thanks, in large part, to the blood, sweat, and tears of co-founder and CEO Alex Jones. On this episode of The CEO Series, we visited Hallow's headquarters to speak with Jones about all things business, leadership, and faith. Below are some highlights from that powerful conversation which have been edited for length and clarity.Related: With Over $120 Million in Sales, Dude Wipes Is No Joke. Here's How the Company's Chief Executive Dude Keeps Things Fun and Profitable.



Divine inspiration""Hallow is a prayer and meditation app for anybody looking to grow closer to God. Its origin goes back to my faith journey. I was raised Catholic but fell away from my faith in high school and college. After I graduated, I got really into meditation. I found these apps that had just launched, Headspace and Calm, and I started using them every day and I loved them. But every time I would meditate, my mind would oddly feel pulled towards something spiritual, like an image of the cross. So I started reaching out to priests, pastors, and folks I knew from Notre Dame and asked what I thought was a really interesting question: Is there any way that there's some sort of intersection between this faith thing and this meditation thing? And they pretty much all laughed at me and said, ""Yeah, we've been doing it for 2000 years. It's called prayer!"" And that changed my life. I knew I needed to do this. I knew how to code a little bit so we built the first version and went from there. The app has helped me grow tremendously in my own spirituality, which has been phenomenal.""Something bigger than themselves""My cousin passed away when he was 45. He died in his sleep randomly. He had just gotten married and his wife was pregnant with their first kid. His mom, who is my aunt, was obviously heartbroken. We had just launched the app and she sent us a note that I have saved to this day. It said, 'I honestly didn't think I'd be able to make it through my first Christmas without my son and I just want you to know that these little meditations on the app are the only thing that's reminded me that I'm able to have hope and that I'm able to get out bed and carry on in this deep time of a pain.' And I just like broke down crying on the floor in my tiny little studio apartment.""

Are you sitting up straight enough? Are you looking in the eyes? Do I like this guy? I had roughly 80 meetings in the first two weeks, just pitching constantly. I remember I went back to my studio apartment after hearing no after no — people basically telling me that the core of who I am is stupid and this idea is never going to work. It was so heavy. I was so stressed. My heart was in pain. My back had all these knots in it. I started praying and I said, 'God, look, this is too much. I can't do this. I'm done. I can't take this weight.' And then I was like, 'I'm gonna make a deal with you. I promise if this thing works out, you're always gonna get the credit. I'm never gonna trick myself into thinking I'm some successful startup CEO who figured all this stuff out. It was all you.' That massive weight immediately lifted and the next day we went for a pitch meeting at a coffee shop with this guy and he gave us a term sheet. And we then get like three, four more the next day.

62,How to Bridge the Gap Between Aspirations and Reality in Business,"Feb 23, 2024","Simin Cai, Ph.D.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-bridge-the-gap-between-aspirations-and-reality-in/469291,"
There's an old joke: What's the difference between medicine and poison? Answer: The dose. The same might be said of the difference between a business vision and wishful thinking — they exist along a spectrum. It all comes back to the gap between the two. Having a dream can inspire action and keep our sense of motivation alive. But if the gap between vision and reality is too vast to be understood or executed, we can grow frustrated in pursuit of that same dream, leading to a profound sense of defeat.The answer is harmonizing our ambitions with what is genuinely achievable, while being careful not to undersell ourselves and what we are capable of — in other words, dream big but plan accordingly. Then, create a step-by-step road map for the big dream and break it off into achievable milestones connecting the steps.Related: The Best Entrepreneurs Are Dreamers Who Can Match Their Vision With Reality



Investing strategy into hope""Hope is not a strategy."" This quote has many fathers, including the football coach Vince Lombardi and the film producer James Cameron. It was used by one CEO surveyed by McKinsey to describe the need to have tough strategic conversations along the road to achieving the dream. Backing the vision with strategic thinking puts hope in its rightful place.According to positive psychology, hopefulness is a life-sustaining human strength. It allows us to think in a goal-oriented way and lay out the pathway to achieve those goals. ""Good"" hope, not fantastical thinking or a pollyannaish defense against a harsh world, also fosters our agency ——the belief that we can make the necessary changes to bring our aspirations into form.


Happiness exists along a continuum, and the smaller the gap, the happier you will be and the more likely you will find investors to share your vision. But, when faced with a lack of available resources, don't lose hope. Getting honest about the distance between aspiration and reality will help new leaders craft a strategy to bridge the gap. Then, it's a matter of finding ways to forge ahead through incremental progress.Related: How Small Incremental Steps Can Help You Achieve Your Largest GoalsSet achievable milestonesIt's well known that the majority of startups fail, suggesting too many budding entrepreneurs don't properly assess the gap and end up falling off the cliff. However, data from 2024 shows that while just 10% of startups go under in year one, this figure blows out to 70% in years two to five. Breaking up a business vision into achievable milestones is crucial to keeping it manageable, but without the solid fundamentals of financing, research, and targeting the right market, success may be short-lived.The first year of a multi-year strategy builds confidence, but it's crucial to keep momentum in the years that follow. The gap refers to not just the overarching vision but the smaller gaps between each year. Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made, such as leaders not even paying themselves as much as their staff until the business moves into sustainable profitability. If even an annual goal is a bridge too far, the same principle applies to setting quarterly milestones. This will build momentum.


When our aspirations are harmonized with our reality, every step towards those goals fuels happiness because we are engaged and purposeful. But there's a catch: Our sense of fulfillment may not come so much from meeting our goals, as exceeding our own expectations. So, leave room for overachieving when breaking down big aspirations. Then, remember to celebrate your wins. It not only stimulates dopamine but strengthens relationships and helps us redouble our efforts for the next challenge.Related: 6 Habits That Turn Dreams Into RealityPivot when facing obstaclesSome challenges to a five-year business plan just cannot be foreseen, especially when macroeconomic conditions change unpredictably. So when reality shifts, we must adjust our aspirations. If things are just taking longer than anticipated, then build it into the plan. In this sense, harmony does not have a fixed center of gravity and is dynamic by nature, so we must always be adapting to keep our goals and capacities within touching distance.Agility is championed as a business virtue for this reason. Changing circumstances may mean a vision is going to take longer to realize. It may mean a detour is required. Or in the worst-case scenario, the original goal may just not be possible. Even then, not all is lost. One of the lessons of the pandemic for small businesses was to pivot into an existing strength, rather than leaping blindly into a new offering altogether.


But a word to the wise: Do not confuse a strategy with an objective — and be wary of idealism. Strategy is how we bridge the gap, but objectives are the signposts along the way. Mistaking one for the other can result in misaligned priorities and improper allocation of resources. Remember, happiness is a state of being — and if we cling so tightly to an aspiration that we forget our reality, we risk pushing it away.Business, like life, is a balancing act of the known and the unknown. We cannot control everything, but we can be careful and deliberate in how we frame our aspirations and set goals toward their realization. As they tell Metro passengers in the U.K., ""mind the gap"" between the platform and the vehicle — between your starting point and how you are going to get to the destination. Harmonizing the two leads to happiness, because it builds trust that we can make our dreams a reality. There will be bumps along the way, of course, but the wise person knows riding them out can reveal deeper parts of our character and foster a more holistic experience of success.

  This Black Founder Was Denied a Business Loan and Set Out to Prove the 'Gatekeepers' Wrong. He's Made More Than $500,000 So Far — But It's Just the Beginning.
  
    Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, started an Instagram account to share his love of floral arrangements — then the requests started rolling in.

      Key Takeaways    



        Gooljar began arranging the flowers his roommate brought home from Trader Joe's in 2020.
      


        He grew the IRIS blossom Instagram account to more than 40,000 followers and has made over $500,000 in just a few years. 
      


        Gooljar is on a mission to keep growing and lift up other diverse creators along the way.
      












""I've always been an artist,"" Rob Gooljar, founder of IRIS blossom, says. ""I've always been a creative person. I've done a lot of mixed media, painting, drawing, music, photography, but my medium shifted to floral.""In 2020, Gooljar was struggling with depression while working toward his Ph.D. in urban, social and economic geography, and he credits his then-roommate Becca Whittier as ""the catalyst"" for his new creative outlet. Whittier would bring flowers home from Trader Joe's, and Gooljar would arrange them.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom



Arranging flowers became a passion, and Gooljar decided to start an Instagram to bring others along on his artistic journey, especially those who might feel excluded from an industry known for lacking diversity. The average florist in the U.S. is 47 years old, and most of them are women (77.2%) and white (77.3%), according to data from Zippia.With his social media platform, Gooljar put out the kind of representation he wanted to see: ""Hey, I'm a queer Black florist — kind of, not really. I'm just playing with flowers, but watch me, and let's see what happens.""


What happened was IRIS blossom, named for Gooljar's rescue pitbull Iris, turned into a successful business.Related: For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.People saw Gooljar's posts on the Instagram account, which grew from zero to more than 40,000 followers, and began asking to buy arrangements. In the past three-and-a-half years, the self-funded company has fulfilled thousands of orders and made more than $500,000 — but it's just the beginning.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossomGooljar is expanding IRIS blossom to South Florida, where he moved last year, while Whittier and two employees continue to helm the company's operations in Greater Charlotte. Meanwhile, he's working with another business partner, Jihann Hanchell, to get IRIS blossom's sister business, island IRIS, off the ground in Turks and Caicos. The idea there is to offer ""full-scale design"" for luxury events.""He was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan.'""Gooljar isn't entering into these floral ventures ""blindly,"" he notes. He also has a holding company and a consulting firm. Still, despite Gooljar's entrepreneurial savvy and IRIS's track record of success and growth, its journey hasn't been without some serious challenges. Two of the biggest barriers, according to Gooljar? Funding and space. And in the floral industry, those tend to go hand in hand.


""It's very hard for small businesses to exist in Charlotte without being pre-existing,"" Gooljar says. ""Pre-existing meaning that A, you come from money or B, you have somebody to help you. So we worked out of our two-bedroom apartment [when] we were doing events that were $15,000-$16,000, and we were doing it on our kitchen island that was six-and-a-half feet long. We had buckets all over the house.""IRIS blossom has been ""100% self-funded"" from the start and able to accomplish all it has thanks to its supportive clients, Gooljar says. The revenue earned goes back into the company's growth, a strategy that's helped it achieve its milestone of $500,000 in revenue in just a few years. But in the early days, Gooljar did try to secure a business loan — and was turned away.Related: This Black Founder Stayed True to His Triple 'Win' Strategy to Build a $1 Billion Business""I had a white banker in Charlotte, and he was really kind, but looked at me and was like, 'Well, you're not going to get a business loan because you have to be in business for a few years,'"" Gooljar recalls. ""And then I would ask, 'Well, how are people who are just starting a business getting a loan?' 'Oh, they probably have an online presence, or they probably just go into it with money, and then they can put up their own money.' That kind of quasi, not-really-plausible explanation about funding and gatekeeping funding.""


Affording space in Charlotte remained a significant obstacle. Eventually, Gooljar and Whittier moved into a three-bedroom apartment. But there still wasn't enough room for the rapidly growing business, and Gooljar didn't want to spend all the money they made on rent. At one point in their search for a reliable place to store their expensive, perishable materials, someone offered to rent them an Airstream travel trailer for thousands of dollars a month sans air conditioning or running water.Now, Gooljar lives and works out of a house in Florida.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom


""It's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is.'""Throughout his time building IRIS blossom, Gooljar says he's ""stepped on a few toes"" within the gatekept industry and has had to field some pointed questions: ""Well, who are you?"" ""Is your business going to last?"" ""How's your little business going?"" ""How's your flower thing going?""But none of that has deterred Gooljar, who comes from a ""very long line of people working hard.""""My grandma cut sugar cane for 40 years in Trinidad,"" Gooljar says. ""My parents came here with nothing and worked and tried their best. And I'm trying to change that tide. So yeah, it's cool when people look at me, and they're wondering if my business is working out: All I can do is smile and say, 'You know, it is, and I'm putting in the work for it.'""

Now She Has $25 Million in Funding — and Smart Advice for Fellow Black Women Founders.Gooljar admits that ""there's still a long way to go"" in transforming the industry into a more inclusive space, but he's happy to report that other diverse floral businesses popped up in Charlotte after his own — because ""there's room for everybody.""""I see some of the landscape changing, especially when I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody else that's Black, or I go into the floral cooler, and I see somebody that's young, or I go in there, and I see somebody with pink hair or something,"" Gooljar says.""You have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall.""Next, Gooljar plans to implement a national subscription program for IRIS, a sort of ""color-by-numbers"" approach. He'll ship the flowers nationwide, and customers can follow along with his arrangements via video. ""I want people who don't feel creative in their current jobs or current lives to get that creative outlet just the same way that I needed that outlet,"" he says.In the long-term, Gooljar's goal is to collaborate with a tech company to make it possible for people to order IRIS flowers on an app ""like they do an Uber."" But even though Gooljar envisions IRIS as a wide-scale service allowing employees to run ""little mini IRIS blossoms out of their own homes,"" quality remains a top priority.Image Credit: Courtesy of IRIS blossom

It's not always easy, and Gooljar admits there have been ""plenty of times"" he wanted to give up, but he's always kept going — never wavering in his belief that great things are on the other side.""You can ask anyone that I know, and they will tell you that they don't know anybody that grinds the way that I do,"" Gooljar says. ""And I'm not saying that you just have to throw yourself into everything all the time. But I think a big part of this is that you have to face those obstacles and keep pushing because there's always going to be people who are preying on your downfall. There are always going to be roadblocks. There are always going to be obstacles. There are always going to be things to climb, but you have to just keep going.""

      Key Takeaways    



        Challenges in managing a client-first business and a passion for solving them with technology inspired Cohen-Shohet to found GlossGenius in 2015.

Danielle Cohen-Shohet.When did you start your side hustle in the self-care industry, and what inspired it?



My interest began when I did freelance makeup artistry out of my Princeton University dorm room. I've always had a passion for design and art, and for as long as I can remember, I have been entrepreneurial. I have a tendency to want to become an expert at something I do, so when I became interested in makeup, I took it much further than most and started a side hustle in college. During that time, my twin sister and I also pursued a digital receipts payments venture. Those were both enriching experiences; however, I had no idea at the time that I'd later take a leap and combine those interests to start a software payments company now worth over $510 million.Related: These Sisters Started a Side Hustle After a 'Light Bulb' Moment Standing in Line for Coffee — Now Their Business Has Done $100 Million in Total Sales


What were some of the first steps you took to get that side hustle off the ground? I learned voraciously, strived to be the best and just rolled up my sleeves to start. Back when I was in college, makeup artistry tutorials were just starting to be democratized on YouTube, so I dove into them and just got my hands dirty practicing. I drilled college classmates and friends for feedback and just kept getting better from there. It sounds simple, but these first steps helped me succeed faster.Were there any challenges that came with running the side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those? Anything that you can grow from will have challenges. While doing makeup artistry, I experienced first-hand the pain points that many of our GlossGenius business customers face today: time management, coordinating schedules and growing a client base without the proper infrastructure, just to name a few. I dove headfirst into solving these challenges with manual spreadsheets and tools that I would hack together, which sparked the idea for what would later become GlossGenius. I wanted to provide other business owners with best-in-class technology and infrastructure that would make it easier to run a business.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? On average, how much revenue did it bring in? For me, it was originally more so about satisfying a creative interest than revenue. It took several months before I started to earn real revenue, and it was meaningful enough to cover a lot of living expenses while in college.Related: She Spent Her Honeymoon Working on a Side Hustle. It Raised $35 Million and Counts Celebrities Among Its Investors.When did you decide to transition into startup mode and found GlossGenius, and what motivated that move?


After understanding the problems facing service-based self-care businesses, I decided to start a software company that would solve many of these problems with technology. I had graduated college and started a career in finance at Goldman Sachs, but I kept thinking about how to help self-care entrepreneurs run better businesses. It was really hard to manage a client-first business when there were so many scattered, disconnected systems.I had taught myself how to code, so I felt as if I could do anything. After getting a couple of years of experience at Goldman, I took a leap and left to start GlossGenius. Given the industry experience, my technical background and the digital receipts payments company I had pursued with my twin sister — who is my partner and chief business officer at GlossGenius — it just felt obvious to put all of this into a software payments company focused on the self-care industry.Image Credit: Courtesy of GlossGenius. Danielle Cohen-Shohet and Leah Cohen-Shohet.How have you approached scaling the company? 


Before we could even think about scaling the company, we first focused on solving a real problem that is a critical part of our customers' lives. There is so much opportunity to empower entrepreneurs to run, manage and scale their own local businesses. Our platform impacts customers' livelihoods, and our solutions are an important part of their everyday lives. That focus was foundational to have in place before scaling.With that in place, one of the things I did early on was learn everything about the business: Building products, launching products, recruiting, marketing, closing partnerships, handling customer support tickets and much more. Having a deep knowledge of all parts of the business has been important to scaling the company as it has helped me understand what excellence looks like in all parts of the business. With that type of understanding, I could surround myself with fantastic people and leaders to take teams even further.Related: The Sweet Side Hustle She Started 'On a Whim' Turned Into a $20,000-a-Month Income Stream: 'It's Simple, It's Affordable and It's Fun'Because there are so many problems to solve for businesses, we also had to remain disciplined in solving the most important problems for customers first. So as we've scaled, we have continued to flex discipline and only pursue initiatives that create value for our customers. We say no often and are thoughtful about how we sequence what we pursue. We obsess over our customers' needs and absorb their feedback like a sponge, as it plays a key role in driving GlossGenius' growth and new products. Keeping the connection with our customers as we've scaled is something I'm really proud of.


When you look to GlossGenius's future, what are you most excited about? We are creating a gateway for entrepreneurship, giving self-care business owners the infrastructure to scale their businesses and empower more entrepreneurship. While we've already built a platform that is mission-critical to our customers, there is still so much for us to do to achieve our mission. With the responsibility of serving over 65,000 businesses and powering billions of dollars of transaction activity, we are working to make our software products more intuitive and magical for customers.The recent launch of our GeniusAI, a generative AI-powered tool, is a good example of this. This tool helps beauty and wellness practitioners draft ready-made, personalized email marketing campaigns, enabling users to simply enter a few notes and receive messages tailored to their goals and brand. In an industry that has traditionally lagged in technological adoption, it is exciting that we get to be the company that puts this in customers' hands. Another recent GlossGenius product launch is Genius Loans — fast, flexible financing that helps customers grow their businesses. Products like this underscore our support of customers with what they need, when they need it — well beyond what's typically expected from SaaS platforms.What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned over the course of your entrepreneurial journey? 


I've learned that true success means helping others succeed. I am fortunate to lead a company that's so tightly aligned with our customers' success. With the opportunity to build and lead GlossGenius, I've had a masterclass in learning the special framework of how to make decisions that build long-term value for customers.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.Do you have any advice for people interested in starting a side hustle or business of their own? Be fearless. Don't take no for an answer. And importantly, surround yourself with like-minded people. You might find this through a community like the one we've created for entrepreneurs with GlossGenius, or you might look to people closest to you. I've had many close supporters along the way, but my strongest collaborator is my twin sister, Leah. She has been a thought partner from day one and has played an invaluable role in expanding the company into what it is today. So surround yourself with people who get you.

68,"For Years, This Black Founder Learned an Uncommon But Essential Craft on the Side. Now His Creations Are Beloved By Celebrity Chefs — and Can Sell for More Than $1,000.","Feb 15, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/middleton-made-knives-founder-followed-passion-into-business/469753,"
Quintin Middleton, artisan and owner behind Middleton Made Knives, found his passion for blades at a young age, inspired by 1980s fantasy films like Star Wars and Conan the Barbarian. ""I wanted to imitate what I saw,"" he recalls, ""and [in] some of the scenes in the movies, they had this blacksmith forging the hero's sword, and I was just enamored by that.""As a child, Middleton would experiment with the craft by beating household items — like his mother's shower curtain rod — into knife handles. But it wasn't until 2003, when he was in college studying to be an aircraft mechanic, that Middleton would get to try his hand at the real deal. Middleton was working at a local knife and cigar shop to earn some extra cash when legendary bladesmith Jason Knight walked through the door.Image Credit: Courtesy of Middleton Made Knives



""He bought a few things and started telling me about himself and was saying, 'Oh, well, I make knives for a living,'"" Middleton says. ""And so [I] lit up, and I asked him, 'Hey, can you teach me? Can I come by your studio workshop one day?' And graciously, he allowed me to."" Middleton would go on to apprentice for Knight for about six years.Middleton stresses that ""to be really good with anything, it takes a lifetime,"" but after about a year of working with Knight, he said he was a ""competent knifemaker"" — and he saw the potential to build his own business around the skill ""from day one."" After college, Middleton worked as an industrial mechanic for Mercedes-Benz, but all the while, he kept ""making knives and learning and pushing and creating.""


Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill. It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.Eventually, Middleton's skill set extended to a variety of knives and swords. But he says he had a dream where ""the Holy Spirit told [him] to make chef knives,"" and ""it was like somebody pointing him in the direction [he] needed to go.""Image Credit: Courtesy of Middleton Made Knives""These are knives, yes, but they're not what a professional chef would want.""So Middleton began doing his research, attempting to replicate the chef's knives he saw in pictures and considering what a chef would need from the tool. Then, once he'd made a few knives, he called ""every top chef in Charleston, South Carolina like a telemarketer"" — and faced rejection after rejection. So he tried a different tactic: He contacted Craig Deihl, executive chef of Cypress and Artisan Meat Share, and asked if he could help develop the chef's knife.""He allowed me to come to his restaurant,"" Middleton says. ""I brought a few knives and laid them out and let his crew check them out. And I'm thinking, maybe I'm going to leave with a few hundred dollars. And somebody's going to buy something. Nobody bought anything. And I was so deflated. And so he told me, 'Okay, these are knives, yes, but they're not what a professional chef would want.'""Middleton asked why that was, and Deihl explained that Middleton's knives, honed from his hunting knife and sword background, were too heavy and thick for a chef's needs. Instead, the ideal chef's instrument would strike a balance between ""a needle and an ax,"" Middleton says.Like an ax, a chef's knife needs ""to be strong and very durable,"" but like a needle, ""it needs to be precise"" and go ""exactly where it needs to go,"" he explains. So that's what Middleton created.


Deihl told his friends about Middleton's chef's knives, and the business started to grow. ""It's almost like throwing a rock in a pond,"" Middleton says. ""I started a small ripple, and it rippled out to other people.""Related: This Is Why Word-of-Mouth Referrals Should Be Your Number One Metric of Success""That's my dream down the road — to create a manufacturing company that's in my town or near.""Middleton Made Knives officially launched in 2010, and in 2011, Middleton was interviewed by Entrepreneur and Garden & Gun, which ""created the big buzz"" that ""solidified him as a maker,"" he says.


Image Credit: Courtesy of Middleton Made KnivesIn the years since, Middleton Made Knives has continued to carve out its space in the industry, supplying hand-made high-carbon steel knives that can retail for more than $1,000 to the nation's top chefs, including Sean Brock, Michael Anthony, Mike Lata and others.Middleton also wants to reach another milestone in his blade-making business: employing people in his hometown of Saint Stephen, South Carolina, a predominantly African American town of less than 2,000 people. ""That's my dream down the road — to create a manufacturing company that's in my town or near where we can produce high-end knives.""Related: She Maxed Out Her Credit Cards and Sold Her Engagement Ring to Start a Business.

69,This Job Hack to Escape Layoffs Is Gaining Popularity — But It's Divisive: 'It Altered My Brain Chemistry',"Feb 15, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/government-jobs-are-going-viral-as-gen-zs-layoff-proof-hack/469798,"
Despite slowing inflation and low unemployment, the New Year started with layoffs. Employees in tech continue to be the hardest hit; the industry lost more than 260,000 jobs in 2023 and cutbacks have continued into the first quarter of this year, according to TechCrunch.In the face of so much uncertainty, U.S. workers, especially the younger set, are seeking more job security. And one potential way to get it has been making the rounds on TikTok: opting for a government job.Working for the government is usually a longer-term gig than private employment — in January 2022, employees in the public sector had a median tenure more than three years higher than that of employees in the private sector, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Last year, one TikTok user's video promoting government jobs went viral with more than half a million views. She cited some of the benefits, including the ""best healthcare"" and the possibility of a pension, though she admitted people wouldn't find ""glamorous stock options.""@boujiebudgeter There is so many opportunities within the federal government thag many people know or understand.. think outside the box when it comes to they types of jobs you are applying to in this season #boujiebudgeter #jobtips #jobsearch #federalgovernment #applyingforjobs #youngrichandresponsible ♬ original sound - BoujieBudgeterCommenters chimed in with tips on how to apply for government jobs and agreement that the job security is ""unmatched."" Still others stressed that private employers can pay ""three times more"" and that ""the background check process is so long.""Related: Snap Inc. to Cut 10% of Total Global Workforce in 'Difficult Decision to Restructure'


Another user's parody video, which garnered more than two million views, takes the benefits enjoyed by some government employees to a humorous extreme: ""Work's making me take time off because I worked for one week last month. So I've accrued like four months off.""@tamzjadecomedy They've always got time off coming up… #governmentjob #longserviceleave #annualleave #overtime #hr ♬ original sound - Tamz Jade ComedyOne commenter said they work for the government and are currently on leave in Bali, potentially revealing some truth to the skit, while others had a different take, saying ""Gov is so hit or miss,"" and that their own ""boring"" government job ""altered [their] brain chemistry because [they] didn't use it.""Related: Poor Leadership Is Going Viral on Social Media Amid Mass Layoffs — Here's What Managers and CEOs Should Do to Keep Their Reputations Intact


As of 2022, the federal government employed roughly 2.87 million people.

Side hustles are increasingly popular among Americans looking to supplement their 9-5 incomes to keep up with record-high cost of living.

71,"Help Now, Win Later — Why Working for Free Can Pay Big Dividends","Feb 14, 2024",Maha Abouelenein,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-working-for-free-can-be-a-good-thing/469090,"
It sounds counterintuitive, but the most financially lucrative business deals I've ever made have been the direct result of doing work for free. Don't believe me? Here's why the strategy works and four tips on how to make working for free pay off for you.Why work for free?If you're like most people, you struggle with the idea of giving away your work. I get it. No one ever wants to feel like they're opening themselves up to the possibility of being taken advantage of or worry that they're wasting the most valuable resource they have — their time.But what many people don't understand is that if you have confidence in the value you're able to provide — and you should! — the best way to maximize your opportunity, in the long run, is to demonstrate what you can do, even if it costs you upfront. With more than 30 years of experience in the communications industry, I've learned that a good client, boss or hiring manager will be smart enough to realize how much you're worth and reward you — and if they don't, that tells you everything you need to know about whether they'd ever appreciate your value, and whether they're the right client or organization to work for.



For example, recently, I was at a film festival and met the CEO of an international company I was certain my team could bring value to. The company wasn't doing much business in the U.S., but I knew that if their story was told in the right way, the floodgates would open. After a first meeting, the CEO made no promises, but I sensed that if I could impress her, I'd win her business. Without much to go on except our intuition, my team and I architected a complete communications strategy that demonstrated our unique way of thinking, spending hours on it. You might be thinking we were wasting our time. But that's the wrong attitude. Even if it didn't work out, I felt confident that it was worth the risk.I arranged a second meeting with the CEO and presented our plan, and it turned out we brought so many ideas the client hadn't even considered that she was happy to give us not just the business we had originally hoped for but even more.


Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying to be naive and open the floodgates. Do your due diligence and make sure the other party is trustworthy and ethical — but I promise, proving yourself to be someone who can create value is the hard part. Once you do that, getting paid is easy. It's a strategy I call ""help now, win later,"" and it's the secret to landing the jobs, gigs, and clients you might only be dreaming about right now.Related: Here's When It's OK to Work for FreeWhat it means to give value firstGiving and delivering first shows people that you intend to serve them. This builds credibility and equity, gives someone the opportunity to get to know you, and forms a relationship. It establishes trust, which is the currency of business throughout the world.In the end, you achieve far greater rewards than you would receive if you insist on formalizing a relationship with payment upfront. Whatever someone would have believed you were worth gets multiplied once they see you in action. Yes, it can be a risk, but it's the kind of risk we should all be eager to take to level up our professional lives.


Related: Your Reputation is Your Currency. How Are You Investing in Yourself?How can you create the kind of value that makes people eager to reward you in the end? I have four principles to guide you:1. Know your strengthsWhat can you do that others can't? What doors can you open for the person or organization you seek to help? What's missing in their business right now, and why are you the right person to fill that gap?


2. Be the firstI like to be the first to show a potential client a new city or introduce them to a new event or experience. They have nothing to compare it to, and chances are they will never forget their first visit. Along the same lines, be the first to open someone's eyes to a new opportunity, a new business idea, or a new way of reaching an audience — and you will own that channel in their mind, and it will ultimately pay off.3. Sell your visionIt doesn't matter how good your idea is if the other party doesn't understand its value. I have made myself a self-appointed ambassador for doing business in the Middle East. There are tremendous opportunities for U.S. companies and brands to work in the region, but before most entrepreneurs invest time and money, they have to understand what I do. A big part of my job is making the case that their investment can pay off — and pay off big. Whatever your unique vision of the world might be, if you can articulate it to potential clients and employers, you can open their eyes to what you see and generate tremendous opportunities for yourself in the process.

If you anticipate the needs of your client, you bring enormous value. This requires being an active observer and noticing what others are missing. You need to be a patient and proactive problem solver. You need to put yourself in the shoes of your target and surprise them every step of the way.With these tips in mind, you can create unexpected value and demonstrate your worth in ways far beyond what a mere business proposal can ever attempt. Far from selling yourself short, helping now — without the expectation of short-term reward — will enable you to win big later.

When people talk about retirement, typically, they're referring to a linear path: Go as far as you can in your career, turn a certain age and leave the professional world for good. It might be the traditional model, but these days, it doesn't work for everyone — for several reasons.More than half (56%) of American workers believe they're behind on their retirement savings, according to a recent Bankrate survey. Meanwhile, since the beginning of 2020, prices of everyday goods and services have increased about as much as they did in the full decade prior to the pandemic, per Bloomberg.Related: This Is the Key to the Retiree Lifestyle You Want — and the Income You Need

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Sina Omosowon, founder of the TV-mounting business Shine.Image Credit: Courtesy of Shine. Sina Omosowon. When did you start your side hustle, and what inspired it?



I started my TV-mounting business, Shine, in 2019. I originally started the business as a side hustle to help put myself through school and support my family. At the time, I was earning my Ph.D. in plant evolution, focusing on food crop production and crop improvement. A friend of mine introduced me to TV mounting and showed me there was a growing demand in this space, particularly as more people chose to mount TVs on their walls versus using a stand to help create more space in their homes. I saw an opportunity to make extra money through TV mounting, so I got trained on the basics and started to build out a business from there. My business ultimately helped me pay for school and finish my Ph.D. with no debt.Related: This Former Amazon Employee Started a Side Hustle Because She Wanted 'Lifestyle Freedom' — Now Her Business Earns $100,000 a MonthWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?After being introduced to TV mounting, I got trained on the basics and shadowed a friend on a few of his jobs. From there, I tried to consume as much information as I could to learn and grow a base of knowledge, watching a lot of YouTube videos and asking questions. As I continued to complete more and more jobs, my confidence grew.When I first started out, it was important to grow awareness of my business and build trust with customers. Without reviews or much experience, I often got customers by giving discounts on jobs. I also learned the importance of being responsive and getting back to customers quickly. I always had my phone on me so that when a request came in, I was able to quickly answer any questions and schedule an appointment.In addition to word-of-mouth, I registered as a pro on Thumbtack, which helped me find customers in my area who needed my services. It was a great place to build out a profile with reviews and photos from completed jobs so potential customers could learn more about me and my business. As I completed more jobs and built up a bank of positive reviews, it became easier to get more clients. Especially as a young entrepreneur, positive reviews help people trust you and give them confidence that you'll do a good job. I now have nearly 1,000 five-star reviews.


I started out doing around two to three jobs a day, and these jobs took more time as I learned different nuances and built up my confidence. Steadily, I started getting more and more customers and became even more efficient at TV mounting, which allowed me to serve more people in a day. Today I can mount a TV in 15 minutes.Related: The 'Easy' Side Hustle He Started in College Hit More Than $1 Million in Revenue — and Taught Him 3 Business Lessons He Still Uses TodayWere there any challenges that came with running your side hustle? If so, how did you navigate those?One of my biggest challenges initially was having to spend money upfront to get my business off the ground, whether that's purchasing all the tools or giving customers discounts on jobs to build up a client roster. This initial investment was important, particularly because it's crucial to have the right equipment for jobs requiring construction. Luckily, I was able to recoup the money I spent upfront after a few months of work.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent monthly revenue? I started seeing consistent monthly revenue about six months after I started. After getting my Ph.D., I received job offers in the plant science space, but my business was also taking off, so I had to weigh my options. It's always been my dream to be my own boss, so I decided to invest in my TV mounting business and take the entrepreneurial path.How much average monthly revenue do you earn now? I earn about $30,000 per month through my TV-mounting business.You've since turned your side hustle into a full-time business. What do you enjoy most about it?Owning my own business lets me control how I spend my time. I can schedule jobs around family commitments and decide when to work and when not to work. I also really enjoy interacting with people on a daily basis and putting a smile on their faces with a job well done. There's a lot of satisfaction in owning your own business.Related: 3 Secrets to Starting a High-Income Side Hustle in 2024, According to People Whose Gigs Make More Than $20,000 a MonthDo you have any advice for others interested in this gig? What should they know before they get started?


My biggest piece of advice for anyone interested in being an entrepreneur is to make customer satisfaction a priority. When you're just starting out, money should not be the priority. It's more important to satisfy the customer, get good reviews and build up a strong client base who can refer you to friends and family. With consistency and steadfastness, the money will come. Prioritize customer satisfaction, and everything will fall into place.

77,Breaking Out of the Matrix — How to Take Control of Your Life and Create a More Fulfilling Future,"Feb 1, 2024",DeAnna Spoerl,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-break-free-from-the-mundane-and-create-a-more/468365,"
Breaking out of the matrix sounds like fun, but what exactly is the matrix anyway? Maybe you've seen the film The Matrix (and if you haven't, I am judging you), and it felt a little too abstract or other-worldly to relate to. You can think of the matrix as a set group of things that affect the way situations develop. In our lives, we may hear the phrases, ""It's my lot in life"" or ""That's just the way it is"" to describe situations that we feel are out of our control. I know I've felt that way before — like the hand I was dealt is all I have to work with. But if you're familiar with the film, you'll recall that Neo, the protagonist and Chosen One, began to experience glitches, or moments of clarity and reality that were out of the norm.Don't get too excited; we won't be catching bullets mid-air any time soon. But I want to encourage you to consider the abnormalities in life and to embrace new paths for a more freeing future as an entrepreneur, business leader and — most importantly — as a human being.Related: 7 Steps to Living a Fulfilled Life



The mundaneThink for a moment about what your typical day looks like. Then a typical week. And finally, a typical month. Do you notice any patterns? Habits? Do you wear the same outfits like a cartoon character every day? Sometimes I feel like Wednesday Addams with the amount of black I wear. Do you drive the same route to work and stop at the same coffee shop? Do you end up having the same conversations and small talk with people you see regularly? Here's the point: When we aren't thinking too deeply about the things we do, we end up repeating them over and over again.As author and neuroscientist, Joe Dispenza explains, the same thoughts lead to the same actions, which lead to no new or significant changes. You don't have to think when you're in the matrix of life. In fact, the matrix doesn't want you to think. And that realization was the moment I knew I needed to make a change in my life. I didn't want the same things to keep happening. I wanted adventure and growth that would leave me fulfilled. So, I started looking for glitches in my daily life.


Get glitchedWhen I think of glitches, I used to associate them with something going wrong or awry. ""My car engine isn't working, it's glitching."" ""My laptop is glitchy."" Or, a regular for me when I stumble over my words: ""My mouth is glitching."" But ever since I've opened my mind to abnormal experiences, I view glitches simply as little moments that seem odd or curious and need attention.For example, if a stranger strikes up a conversation with me about a recent book or author I've just started reading (true story), that feels like a glitch in the matrix. Something broke through in that moment and connected us in a strange way. Another time, I was cleaning out an old wallet and found a Health Savings Account (HSA) debit card from two jobs ago, and I happened to log into my account — surprised it was still active — and discovered hundreds of dollars just sitting there. Thirty minutes later (remember, this is also a true story), I got a call from a medical provider whose first question was, ""Do you have an HSA account that can cover this expense?"" Glitch? Well, some might call it synchronicity or luck or divine intervention.But it's moments like these that are out of the ordinary and indicate, at least to me, that there's been a breakthrough. The key to these experiences is to ride with them. Embrace them. Don't shrug them off as weird instances (but they are weird, I 100% agree). This is where the magic happens.Related: Embrace the Unknown to Transform Your Life


Not the Magic Kingdom, but still magicalLet's take a moment to pause here. You don't have to believe in magic. Or miracles. Or anything in the realm of the intangible. But if we want to see an undeniable change in our lives, a ""quantum flip"" if you will, we must be open to the mystery of the magical. These are the stories we love to read about: the person who faced multiple tragedies and later became a world-famous movie star. Or the child who suffered unbelievable trauma and became a multi-billionaire by helping others (Keanu Reeves and Oprah Winfrey, respectively, in case you were wondering).Perhaps in your personal life, you've witnessed a loved one turn their circumstances around to experience a fulfilling, exciting life. We may ask how it happens. Well, it happens in those moments of fear, anxiousness and hesitation. It happens in those moments when you just go for it. When you take a wrong turn or when you pick a new coffee shop, unafraid of doing something different, and you allow whatever is around the corner to happen. Life is waiting for you to shake it up.Be freedThese moments are small, seemingly insignificant decisions that could totally free you from the matrix. In my life, I've experienced quantum flip moments many, many times. One in particular was when I made the tough decision to quit a fairly stable but problematic job. The decision was made without a backup plan, and it put my family in a one-income situation that scared me. Within two weeks, however, my lost income was more than made up for with the small business my husband and I operated.I took a leap, and it liberated me. I felt freed. I felt a trust within myself I had never felt before. And that trust is really a major point in this piece of written content. I want whoever is reading this to be freed. Freed from the stress of your high-paying but miserable managerial position. Freed from the burdens of financial forecasting or debt you're taking on as an entrepreneur. Freed from the fear of what to do next or of not doing anything at all and becoming complacent.


Related: How to Get Your Conscious Mind in the Driver's Seat and Create Control in Your LifeWhatever being freed from the matrix means for you, whatever your desire is, I hope with all my heart you find your freedom. It starts small, so small. But believe me, however small you think your start is, the payoff is huge. Switch things up. Take a new route to work tomorrow. Wear your hair differently. Say hello to a stranger. Quit your job and hop on a plane. This life we live is full of surprise and mystery, and the best part is that it isn't only for a select few. It's for us all. And if your ""lot in life"" sucks, pick a new lot. We only have one life to live. Don't you want control over yours?

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Michael Pan, who built his side hustle, Pan's Mushroom Jerky, into a full-time business over the course of a decade. To date, Pan's Mushroom Jerky has seen more than $1,000,000 in sales. Image Credit: Courtesy of Pan's Mushroom JerkyWhat was your full-time job and/or primary source of income prior to starting your side hustle? Did it change over the course of your side hustle journey?I earned an electrical engineering degree from the University of Illinois, and I spent most of my career at Motorola/Continental Automotive in Chicago.Along the way, I launched a tech startup with friends until we sold the business in 2016.



These full-time jobs allowed me to test the market, learn and iterate along the way. Finally in 2016, I was in a position to dedicate everything to Pan's, and I made the transition to work on the business full-time.Related: These Sisters Started a Side Hustle After a 'Light Bulb' Moment Standing in Line for Coffee — Now Their Business Has Done $100 Million in Total SalesWhen did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?I took a trip to visit family in 2006 in Malaysia, where I met a vegetarian cousin who had been making our family's mushroom snack for years. As vegetarians, they had trouble finding foods that not only tasted great but also had great texture. And they found that mushrooms were very satisfying and healthy.


This opened my eyes to an amazing culture with innovative foods that mimic the texture of meat. I fell in love with the product and its history, and I knew our family had a snack that needed to be shared with the world.What were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?I first learned how to import the product from my family in Malaysia. I sampled the product as often as I could to test demand and gather consumer feedback. I quickly found out that many types of people, including non-vegetarians, loved it because it was a healthy snack that tasted great.I started selling on our website (which we powered through Shopify) and Amazon for direct business. I started to cold email, call and visit as many stores as I could to get more sales and distribution.


Meanwhile, I also did some product development and worked on transferring production to the United States. I rented small kitchen spaces, made products, tested, iterated and repeated that process frequently. I used the cash from online sales and sampling events to reinvest back into the business.Related: After This 26-Year-Old Got Hooked on ChatGPT, He Built a 'Simple' Side Hustle Around the Bot That Brings In $4,000 a MonthWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?It's hard to avoid the amount of capital it requires to get started from scratch. Luckily I had some 401k cash along with debt I could leverage to help get the business off the ground.


How long did it take you to begin seeing consistent weekly or monthly revenue?It took about two years.When did it surpass the income of your full-time job?After about year three, I started making enough income to match my previous full-time job.When did you decide to go all-in and transition from side hustle to full-time business?After wrapping up another startup venture in 2016, I decided to go all in on the business.Luckily at that time, all the trends were aligning. Mushrooms were trending; healthy, on-the-go snacking was still gaining popularity; and plant-based foods were booming. I felt confident that we had product-market fit and a quality product that would succeed.Related: She Started a Furniture-Flipping Side Hustle to Pay Off a $10,000 Dental Bill.

What's your advice for other side hustlers who hope to turn their ventures into successful businesses?Being mentally ready for challenges ahead is very important. Having the mindset to grow and learn is essential. The right mindset will prepare you to embrace challenges as stepping stones to success.Learn and iterate as quickly and cheaply as possible! Push to learn and iterate quickly instead of waiting for everything to be perfect before moving forward.

Sabeena Ladha, founder and CEO of the ""good-for-you"" snack brand DEUX, has a ""pretty deep relationship with junk food."" That's ""kind of a funny thing to say,"" she admits, but her childhood in the small town of Euless, Texas, where her father ran a gas station and convenience store, kicked off the passion for snacks that would help shape her professional endeavors.""My parents worked 24/7,"" Ladha recalls. ""They're immigrants, so they had that hard work ethic built in them. So he was working 12-, 14-hour days, six, seven days a week, and on the weekends, my sisters and I would go to the gas station, and we would get to pick a snack. I always picked one salty and one sweet snack."" They weren't necessarily the most healthful choices, but at the time, those products weren't quite as ""villainized"" as they are today, she says.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX. Sabeena Ladha. 



Although Ladha ""looked healthy"" as a high school athlete who played basketball and ran track, she quips that her ""insides were made of partially hydrogenated oil and trans fats."" It wasn't until college that she dove into health and wellness, even starting a blog ""before it was cool"" to unpack juice cleanses and cryotherapy.Related: After Being Diagnosed With Cancer, She Created a Cookie That Would Help Her Eat Cleanly and Satisfy Her Sweet Tooth. Now, Her Products Are Sold in 25,000 Stores.


""Not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""""[I was] trying to make the scary world of wellness a little bit more approachable for Sabeena in Texas,"" Ladha explains. ""Not everyone lives in Los Angeles and has access to 18 farmers markets on a Saturday. That's just not realistic. And not everyone wants to eat a salad for every meal of the day, so how do you help people make slightly better decisions?""Answering that question ultimately led Ladha to the ""healthy indulgences"" concept of DEUX. The hot-pink brand offers cookie doughs, dessert spreads and donut holes that are vegan, gluten- and preservative-free and contain ""functional ingredients"" like vitamin B12 to support sustained energy and L-Theanine to help with cognitive function and mental focus.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


Ladha was ready to ""break the rules"" and innovate in the snack space, but she credits much of her success with the fact that she learned those rules before she broke them. Her previous experiences working on Frito-Lay at PepsiCo, managing a P&L at Diamond Foods, consulting at McKinsey & Company and launching brands in venture capital helped build a strong foundation for her entrepreneurial journey.Related: The Founders of This Paleo, Gluten-Free and Vegan Brand Say It Succeeded Because of Its Restrictions""[Experimenting with scale] required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that.""Ladha started experimenting with chocolate chip cookie dough in her kitchen in June 2020, when the pandemic was well underway, and many people wanted to graduate from the ""sourdough and wine phase"" and indulge in healthier ways, she says. Today, all of DEUX's cookie doughs have a similar base, incorporating oats, nut butter, flaxseed and coconut sugar.


But one of the biggest challenges in those early days was figuring out how to scale DEUX's perfect recipe with a manufacturer. ""You would think it's [just] math, right?"" Ladha says. ""Like, you just scale up the recipe into making 3,000 pounds instead of one pound. And it really did not work like that. It got drier; it got a little bit more dense. It wasn't as sweet. So you have to then go through iterations, and that required some capital because there's a lot of waste that comes with that too.""Related: This Entrepreneur Believes Courage Is the Key Ingredient for SuccessInitially, Ladha didn't want to raise capital; she put $20,000 of her own money into the business and resolved to test the product first. Ladha was more than willing to pivot if the idea didn't gain traction, noting that she ""wanted an idea that would work"" rather than one that had to be ""force fit"" into the market. But DEUX was ""profitable on first ship,"" and once Ladha realized the serious potential there, she decided to raise.Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUX


To date, DEUX has raised about $6 million. The company's first fundraising round kicked off in January 2021, and Ladha says that capital — and the ability it gave DEUX to produce at a significantly higher volume — made it possible for her to appear on Shark Tank after its producers reached out. Ladha didn't land a deal on the show, but DEUX has continued to see tremendous growth in the years since.""[If you] take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit.""DEUX has transitioned from an exclusively direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand to one with a significant retail presence in Target, Whole Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets and more. DEUX hit 1,000,000 units sold last year and more than doubled its store count to 2,600 in 2023. And in the first half of 2024, DEUX will see that figure skyrocket again with the launch of donuts at major retailers nationwide, totaling more than 4,000 stores across its three product lines.Ladha says that retail will make up the ""lion's share"" of DEUX's revenue this year but stresses that DTC remains important for the brand for two reasons: data collection and marketing opportunities. The former helps the business understand who its customers are and which flavors resonate with them, and the latter has allowed it to explore brand collaborations, like its recent Buttercream Sugar Cookie with The Skinny Confidential.


Image Credit: Courtesy of DEUXRelated: Freshly's Founder Ditched Wall Street to Start a Restaurant in Arizona With His Parents. It Failed, But He Pivoted to Build a $1.5 Billion Business.Now, Ladha is focused on making DEUX a household name — ""full stop."" She envisions it as a ""better-for-you Nestlé"" with a modern twist and says a not-so-""sexy"" ""tech mindset"" is helping it get there.""It sounds much cooler to be like, 'You know, I was just making this cookie dough for my friends and family, and then I went to a farmer's market, and Whole Foods discovered me, and now I'm at Whole Foods now nationally,'"" Ladha says. ""That's a cooler story, right? But if you can collect data and test and learn and take that kind of tech mentality and bring it to food, it will just help you understand if there's actually product-market fit. That's why I joke, 'Don't do it — but see if you should do it.'""

81,Crafting Your Best Year Ever — 5 Pillars for Meaningful Growth and Success,"Jan 30, 2024",John Peitzman,https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/5-pillars-for-meaningful-growth-and-success/468722,"
As each new year unfurls, it brings with it an opportunity for personal transformation and growth. While setting resolutions is a tradition, embracing a holistic approach encompassing meaningful relationships, continuous understanding, strategic implementation, purposeful leadership and holistic excellence can truly pave the way for your best year ever.Here are five critical steps toward meaningful growth and success.Related: 6 Ways to Hack Your Learning Process for Sustainable Personal Growth



1. Build meaningful relationshipsAt the heart of a fulfilling life lie relationships that nurture and empower. Cultivate connections that enrich your life and the lives of those around you. Invest time in deepening friendships, strengthening family bonds and fostering professional networks. Meaningful relationships provide support, guidance and a sense of belonging that contributes significantly to personal growth and happiness.Start by listing specific key relationships you currently have and new ones you want to create this year. Identify how you can set up regular communication or meetings with these key individuals and/or seek opportunities for collaborative projects. Whether it is a personal or professional relationship, acknowledge why this is important to you and how you plan to make it happen.


Related: 10 Truths for Making Change Successful2. Understand through growthContinuous learning and growth are vital elements in crafting an exceptional year. Seek understanding through various avenues — read diverse books, enroll in courses, attend workshops, and engage in reflective practices. Embrace challenges as opportunities to expand your skills and knowledge. By understanding different perspectives and continuously evolving, you equip yourself to navigate life's complexities more effectively.Make a list of your key personal and professional interests and passions and how you can learn more about these. Analyze your strengths and areas for personal and professional growth, and then seek opportunities for improvement in both these areas. When it comes to personal or professional projects/goals, develop a plan for your most significant personal project, break each process down into actionable steps, assign tasks and deadlines, monitor progress, and adjust strategies as needed.3. Implement the right strategiesCrafting a successful year involves strategic planning and execution. Define your goals clearly, and outline actionable steps to achieve them. Break down larger objectives into manageable tasks and milestones. Embrace flexibility, allowing room for adjustments as you progress.


By implementing well-thought-out strategies, you create a roadmap towards accomplishing your aspirations. When it comes to personal or professional projects/goals, develop a plan for your most significant personal project, break each process down into actionable steps, assign tasks and deadlines, monitor progress and adjust strategies as needed.Related: How to Find Clarity in Your Personal and Professional Life4. Lead with purposeLeadership extends beyond professional realms; it encompasses personal endeavors as well. Lead your life with purpose and intention. Define your values, and align your actions accordingly. Embrace authenticity, empathy and resilience in your journey. By leading with purpose, you not only inspire others but also create a sense of fulfillment and direction in your own life.Leading with purpose begins with defining the leadership qualities you want to develop or enhance and the actions you plan to take toward that end. One should always keep in mind how they want to model leadership behavior and the people with whom they want to include in their shared vision.


5. Excel in every wayStrive for holistic excellence in every facet of your life. Balance is key. Aim for excellence in your career, health, relationships, personal development and leisure. Embrace a healthy lifestyle that nourishes your body and mind. Set high standards while being compassionate with yourself. Celebrate achievements, no matter how small, and learn from setbacks to continually improve. The best way to excel is to focus on continuous improvement, seek feedback, set and hold yourself to high standards and lead with your heart.Combining these five pillars — building meaningful relationships, understanding through growth, strategic implementation, purposeful leadership and holistic excellence — creates a robust framework for an exceptional year.Related: 25 Daily Practices that Executives Credit for Continuous Self-GrowthStart by examining your current relationships. Are there areas that need nurturing or bridges that need building? Allocate time and effort to foster connections that uplift and support you.

Define your goals for the year, breaking them down into actionable steps. Stay adaptable to adjustments while remaining focused on the end objective.Concurrently, infuse purpose into your actions. Align your decisions and actions with your core values. Lead by example, inspiring not only yourself but also those around you.Lastly, strive for excellence in every facet of your life. Embrace a balanced approach that ensures growth across various dimensions, be it personal or professional.

This Side Hustle Spotlight Q&A features Elise Whang and Emily Erkel, co-founders of B2B marketplace platform LePrix, which offers a curated space for sourcing pre-owned luxury items from top suppliers around the world.LePrix has done more than $100 million in topline gross merchandise value since launch. It has raised $15 million to date and is the largest B2B pre-owned luxury platform globally, with over 150,000 units of pre-owned luxury at wholesale prices per month, according to the company.How did your corporate careers prepare you to launch the side hustle that would become LePrix? 



Whang: Early on in my legal career, I had the opportunity to meet entrepreneurs from mega-corporations who had built their businesses from scratch. Their journey was fascinating and inspiring to me; however, I quickly realized entrepreneurs are often over-glamorized. Lawyers see all the blemishes and the challenges and hardships business owners face as well. This experience helped me take the proverbial leap with my eyes wide open. Importantly, being a lawyer also trained me how to write thoughtfully, be persuasive and take measured risks. I also learned that what I enjoyed most about being a lawyer would carry over to being an entrepreneur — helping people and fixing problems.Erkel: My career in retail strategy consulting prepared me for the launch of LePrix in so many ways. Each project was a different opportunity to help a client overcome a challenge and succeed — whether it was launching a large Japanese fast-fashion retailer in the U.S., helping a women's specialty retailer go omnichannel or [helping] an iconic luxury brand house known for its handbags expand into other categories. The skills I learned to quickly identify the problem, be creative with the solution and help the retailer execute helped me learn the skills that every entrepreneur needs: strategy, execution, grit and adaptability.

It Surpassed Her Full-Time Job's Income Within a Year — Earning Up to $37,000 a Month.When did you start the side hustle that would become your company, and what was the inspiration behind it? Whang: When that first amazing business idea dawns on you, it is like a bright light bulb going off in your head. It first lit up when I was standing in line for coffee before work knowing I had to work over the weekend. What I really wanted to do over the weekend was go to my favorite consignment stores with my sisters, but these stores all closed at 7 p.m., and I could not get there. So why not bring all these wonderful designer consignment stores online? This first iteration of our business was consumer-facing, aiming to aggregate the best designer consignment stores online in one platform. This laid the groundwork for our present business model, focusing on business-to-business (B2B) pre-owned luxury wholesale.In the early days, I juggled my entrepreneurial pursuits with my demanding role as a lawyer. My side hustle typically unfolded between 8 p.m. to 2 or 3 a.m. and consumed weekends for several years. Fast forward — the light bulb went off again when we saw that our stores were buying from each other more and more on our platform. We realized they needed a way to source pre-owned authentic handbags and jewelry from other trusted businesses online. We then launched the first B2B pre-owned luxury wholesale auction houses from across the globe to retailers in the U.S., and it grew from there.


At which point did you decide to leave your corporate jobs to focus on LePrix full-time, and what motivated you to take the leap? Whang: I was eight months pregnant, happily married, with a great job as a lawyer. I was patting myself on the back for being the first female lawyer in our family. But I was also panicking that life was going by at warp speed, and if I didn't take the leap soon to work on this great business plan, it may never happen. In hindsight, I was probably going through a midlife crisis. We applied to an accelerator program and got in, but they required only full-time founders, which meant I had to quit my day job. I was scared about what our immigrant parents, who worked their behinds off to give us the American dream, would think. My husband asked me what I was going to do — and I said I wanted to take a bet on this business; otherwise, I'd regret it on my deathbed (I know, dramatic). I popped out my baby and then started my entrepreneurial journey. I haven't looked back since.Related: Being 'Lazy' Paid Off: Her Failed Side Hustle Led to a Business That Brings in Over $100 Million a YearErkel: At the time, I had been at a large specialty retailer, working with the leadership team on different strategies, from growing their new baby business to exploring ways to shorten lead time from design to delivery. It was an amazing experience and a great team, but part of me yearned to build something that was more aligned with my passion growing up. When I was younger, I was obsessed with fashion, especially luxury and vintage. When my co-founder and sister, Elise, approached me with the idea of launching this as a side hustle, my gut reaction was an immediate yes. Once we started gaining traction and growing quickly, I knew it was time to go full-time, but I was nervous. Innately, I am more risk averse, but the numbers (and Elise) are very convincing. Would I rather be a cog in a wheel or chart my own course and try something new and exciting that there was clearly a market demand for? The answer was clear.


What have been some of the biggest challenges you've faced over the course of your founding journey so far, and how have you overcome them? Whang: One of the significant challenges we faced was securing funding from venture capitalists (VCs). The reality of less than 5% of female founders successfully raising funds from VCs is real. Our company deviates from the conventional VC company profile; we're far from resembling the stereotypical characters depicted in the HBO show Silicon Valley (one of my favorite shows). Notably, our team is 60% BIPOC, with two female founders, and we take immense pride in this diversity. We have, however, successfully secured funds from private investors and early-stage VCs who wholeheartedly believe in our vision, the business, its potential and our team.Erkel: Another challenge was the pivot from B2C to B2B. It was clear that the way to help our stores was not selling but sourcing. For businesses, sourcing pre-owned luxury is difficult, risky and expensive because the wholesale industry for luxury resale is highly fragmented. As our B2B business continued to take off, Elise and I knew it was time to sunset our B2C business. It was a decision we thought very carefully about as the B2C business was not only our first baby, but we had also built a pretty successful business. However, the growth of the B2B business was immense, and with limited resources and time, we knew it was time to double down on B2B.Related: I Spent the Last 3 Years Building My Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Business. Here's What I Learned.What are you most excited about as you look to LePrix's future? Erkel: As the leader in the B2B pre-owned luxury industry, we are most excited to be the driving force making luxury resale accessible to retailers globally. We have the opportunity to change the industry, help retailers meet consumer demand and, most importantly, make a sustainable impact.What's your best advice for other side hustlers who hope to turn their gigs into full-time ventures?Whang: Don't quit your day job until you have some data or traction. DO build out a business model with your data and make an informed decision to take the leap. Don't obsess about hyper growth anymore, but DO build a profitable business — it's still a business. Don't kick yourself for failing. DO learn from your mistakes and quickly pivot.


Erkel: Don't be scared to take the leap. Life is short, and time is limited. If your side hustle shows traction and the only thing that is holding you back is fear, overcome it. Don't let fear dictate your life and stop you from moving forward. Life is more fulfilling if you're doing what you love.

Retirement should be a time of relaxation and enjoyment, but for many Americans, it's a source of financial anxiety.More than half (56%) of American workers believe they're behind on saving for retirement — and 37% feel they're ""significantly behind,"" according to a recent Bankrate survey.But where people choose to live out their golden years can make or break their retirement. A new study from WalletHub reveals the best states for retirees, evaluating crucial factors like tax rates, cost of living, access to quality healthcare and fun activities.

Colorado promises a retiree-friendly tax environment, high-quality healthcare and a community where seniors are less socially isolated and predominantly in good health and financial standing. The active lifestyle and excellent geriatric care might especially appeal to health-conscious retirees.


3. Virginia looks after its seniors' well-being with robust elder abuse protections and highly regarded medical care. The state has a reputation for being tax-friendly without estate or inheritance taxes and also boasts miles of shoreline, low crime rates and clean air.4. Delaware has one of the lowest tax burdens nationwide. Its significant senior population translates to a strong sense of community and minimal social isolation. It also has the lowest poverty rate among seniors aged 65 and up.5. Wyoming stands out for its commitment to elder safety, clean air and a sense of community evidenced by high senior volunteering rates. It also has low tax burdens, with no estate or inheritance taxes.Image Credit: christiannafzger | Getty Images. Snake River near Jackson, Wyoming. Related: Looking to Retire?

84,10 Ways to Be a Better You at Work in 2024,"Jan 23, 2024",Elisabeth Carpenter,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/10-ways-to-be-a-better-you-at-work-in-2024/468232,"
Many of us struggle with the start of the new year. We reflect on the year past and set resolutions for the year ahead. Usually, we associate both with feelings of falling short.One way to break this cycle is to shift from extrinsic goals to intrinsic ones.You will probably devote at least 2,000 hours to your job this year. It's tempting to link this effort to extrinsic motivations: better titles, higher pay, industry awards and so on. Yet doing so can leave us stripped of agency and purpose. First, it yokes us to the perception and action of others. Second, it can cause structural misalignment. The satisfaction of a promotion, for example, is surprisingly fleeting — especially if we were chasing prestige instead of deeper engagement.



Intrinsic goals, on the other hand, reflect our identity, not our ambitions. Instead of outward signs of status, they point us toward interior growth. Intrinsic goals are entirely within our control, and reaching them brings durable rewards.In the workplace, an extrinsic goal might be ""Grow my income 20% this year."" An intrinsic goal might be ""Show more gratitude to my colleagues.""


In this spirit, I want to offer ten intrinsic resolutions that will help you grow in 2024. These reflect timeless insights my mentors have shared with me, as well as hard lessons I've learned throughout my career.Related: 5 Simple Resolutions That Will Make You Smarter, Happier and More ConfidentResolution 1: Don't stay in the same role for more than a yearThis does not mean striving for a promotion or jumping ship to a new company. Instead, embrace a mindset of constant learning so that the role you're in is always presenting new challenges and opportunities.Ask yourself:


What new skills have you learned this past year?Have you expanded your perimeter of influence?Have you stretched your portfolio?Are you staying in the comfort zone of your strengths, or are you attacking your weaknesses?If it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you. Start small, but start. You'll be amazed at the opportunities that flow from this growth mindset.Resolution 2: If you don't feel the company's mission in your gut, something's wrongWhen looking for jobs, many of us prioritize three Ps: pay, prestige and product. That's a trap. Two different Ps are the ones that matter: purpose and people. The rewards of pay and prestige are fleeting. Products evolve. The quality of our relationships with colleagues and the rationale for exerting our time and energy, on the other hand, are central to our job — and life — satisfaction.Ask yourself:Do you wake up every morning fired up about the mission and purpose of your company? (I sure do!)Do the people in your company inspire you to be a better professional and person?Do you have a burning desire to hone the skills that your company is teaching you?Resolution 3: How many mentors do you have at your current company?If you haven't explicitly asked a colleague to play this role, chances are the answer is zero.Mentorship is not a one-time pep talk or an ad hoc introduction to an influential figure. It's an ongoing commitment to personal and professional growth — which means it's more than ego-stroking. If your mentor hasn't held you accountable or offered constructive feedback, you might need to rethink the relationship.


The best time to find an internal mentor is even before you start. Yes, it's a big ask, but it's also a big investment. Don't be shy. Share your ambitions and ask for help.Resolution 4: Every organization has a core. To maximize your growth, get as close to the core as possible.Ask yourself:How does your current job role connect to your employer's core?How can you reskill or upskill to get even closer to the core?Resolution 5: Don't undermine your value with hedging languageThis resolution is for everyone but is especially important for professional women.Examples: ""I'm new here, so…,"" ""As the least technical person in the room…,"" ""I think…,"" ""I just…,"" ""I could be wrong, but…""Yes, nuance and precision matter, as do relevant qualifiers. But more often than not, people will remember your caveat, not your point.Relatedly, resist the temptation to explain to your audience who you are as a person. ""I'm still new here, so I still have a lot to learn…"" or ""I haven't spent a lot of time with X or Y team, so could be wrong, but…"" and so on. Allow colleagues to see you based on your actions, not your words telling them how to think about you.


Don't be put off or intimidated by people who like to hear themselves speak or act like the smartest person in the room. Volume and frequency are terrible predictors of business wisdom. So, speak when it counts and do it with conviction.Related: 3 Steps to Get Your Personal and Professional Life Back on TrackResolution 6: Don't settle for the job for which you're already fully qualifiedGo for the larger role. Push yourself out there, even if it makes you slightly uncomfortable. Actually, do it because it makes you uncomfortable. That's how we grow.Resolution 7: Pose the best questions, not the best answersIn a world that prizes witty talking points, what we crave at work are honest questions.


Think about the last time a colleague or manager took the time to ask you thoughtful questions. How did it make you feel? And how did it make you feel about them and the company? Aspire to be the teammate or team leader who brings relentless curiosity to the task.Resolution 8: Kick ass without being an assHopefully, this one doesn't need much explanation. In all the companies I've helped lead, we've followed a ""no assholes"" hiring policy, and it's served us very well. I look for ambitious, goals-driven candidates who are unafraid to tackle hard problems — and who do so respectfully, which includes enjoying opportunities to share credit and celebrate teammates' successes when relevant.Resolution 9: Grab the micLook for ways to be an ambassador for your brand. This doesn't require a keynote presentation at a prestigious conference. Volunteer to onboard your next cohort of interns. Give talks at your local high school or community college. Host an employee resource group. Be an active mentor to your network on LinkedIn.Resolution 10: Lead with loveThis is hopefully the whole point of your professional development and ambition: so you can scale love.


Let's face it. Jobs are hard. Stressful. Even scary sometimes. Yet they are also a profound opportunity to bring out our best — and, importantly, the best in others.As David Brooks has noted, people won't review your resume at your funeral. They'll discuss your virtues. Your impact on others. Your service to the world.Your job is a powerful instrument to express your character. What impression are you making?Related: 5 Powerful Ways to Become Your Best SelfI'd like to close with a personal note of gratitude to my most important mentor: my mother.I saw her in action on a daily basis, building a business with my father from nothing into a thriving architectural firm that still exists today. As one of a handful of women who graduated from MIT's Architecture program in the 1950s, she was the ""RBG"" of the architecture world. Her ability to be a shrewd, strategically-minded businesswoman despite all of the odds stacked against her as a one-eyed woman (she lost her eye in a childhood accident) in a man's world was impressive enough.More importantly, she had love coursing through her veins with everything she touched.By the time she died, she left a legacy of dozens of buildings she and my father designed and hundreds of students whom she taught at a local architecture program who showed up in strength at her funeral to underscore their love for her. I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for her.

If you're considering a career change this year, it pays to investigate where you'll actually be better off. And that might not necessarily be the company offering the highest salary.Nowadays, U.S. employees want more from their companies, including flexible work and transparent leadership. In fact, when people have the option to work flexibly, 87% of them will take it, per McKinsey & Company's recent American Opportunity Survey. And relationships with management are the No. 1 factor in employee satisfaction, according to another report from the consulting firm.Related: Why Office Perks Aren't Enough to Attract and Retain Millennials

87,How Being the Middle Child Impacts Your Success in Business and Life,"Jan 9, 2024",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-being-the-middle-child-impacts-long-term-success-in-life/468044,"
Have you ever wondered how birth order impacts success in business and life?Whether you're the oldest, middle, youngest or only child, your position within the family does affect your upbringing and future — though to an extent that varies considerably depending on individual circumstances.Alfred Adler, a 19th- and early 20th-century Austrian psychotherapist and founder of individual psychology, introduced the idea that birth order affects a child's development — and claimed that ""middle children are optimally positioned in the family and are characterized by emotional stability,"" per Scientific American.



Related: How Being the Oldest Child Impacts Your Success in Business and LifeYet the so-called ""middle child syndrome"" has also come to be associated with children born between the oldest and youngest siblings. Middle children might be more rebellious and sociable, and they might be more likely to move far away and less likely to strive for perfectionism, according to WebMD.


Entrepreneur sat down with Dr. Brittany McGeehan, a licensed psychologist based in Frisco, Texas who specializes in working with high-achieving women, to learn more about how being the middle child can impact success in business and life.""They're the peacemakers, typically, so they have absolutely wonderful negotiation skills.""Although McGeehan acknowledges that any generalizations about birth order and success are ""painting with a broad brush"" and may not ring true for everyone, she says that middle children tend to go down one of two paths.The first — and more common, according to McGeehan — comes with significant advantages for middle children navigating the business world.Related: Are Some People Born to Be Entrepreneurs?""They're the peacemakers, typically,"" McGeehan says, ""so they have absolutely wonderful negotiation skills, and they are usually able to read a room and see what the room needs to calm down. —[from] childhood all the way up [to] sitting in a boardroom or wherever.""Middle children who fall into this category are inclined to ""go with the flow"" and ""show up in the way that they need to in order to maintain balance,"" McGeehan adds.Related: 5 Benefits of Teaching Young Children About Entrepreneurship


""There is potential for middle-borns, in general, to end up less successful if they're hell-bent on 'I need to prove myself.'""But some middle children will try a different tack — one motivated by their desire to stand out, McGeehan says.""They feel that need to prove themselves,"" McGeen explains, ""[and] you can see this going astray versus really sort of leaning into [their] negotiation and compromise skills. There is potential for middle-borns, in general, to end up less successful if they're hell-bent on 'I need to prove myself' versus building a foundation of skills that are actually sustainably going to be able to help propel them through a career.""Fortunately, with all of the information available on the internet and social media, many parents today are well-informed about the potential challenges of being a middle child and can take steps to mitigate them, McGeehan notes.

Parents who don't feel like their family is complete should be ""really, really honest with themselves"" and consider if they have the emotional and financial resources to raise all of their kids ""effectively and responsibly.""""I just want to be like, 'Don't forget about your middle children,'"" McGeehan says.

88,The Only Business Idea You Need to Start Making Money,"Jan 2, 2024",Terry Rice,https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-only-business-idea-you-need-to-start-making-money/439210,"
If you do a Google search for ""business ideas"" you'll quickly get overwhelmed and confused by articles offering numerous, random suggestions. And while some of the ideas may be inspiring, they also miss the most obvious - and easiest - way to generate revenue as an entrepreneur.Become a professional service provider based on the skills you already have.Think you can't do it? Think again. Because if you've ever excelled and enjoyed any job-related task, you can sell that service to organizations and individuals.



Following this process helps you avoid many of the risks associated with entrepreneurship. It helps you avoid imposter syndrome by doing something you know you are good at, and since you've been paid for them in the past, you know there's a market for your services .So stop looking externally for business ideas. Everything you need to start a business is already within you. Here's a three step process to get you started.


Determine your zone of geniusIt's time to get paid, and the first step is to determine your Zone of Genius, which are the tasks you feel uniquely qualified to perform and enjoy. This term comes from the book The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks and I'll walk you through the process of discovering yours now.We'll start by gaining a basic understanding of the various zones of competence.Incompetence: You're not good at these things and don't want to beCompetence: You can perform these tasks but others can do it just as wellExcellence: You can perform these activities extremely well but it may not be as rewarding as you'd like at times.Genius: These are the activities you enjoy and want to keep developing. You could talk about them for hours and never get bored. This is the service you'll offer to clients.Next, open up this spreadsheet. In Column E jot down all the organizations you've worked at. Once you've completed that, write down all the major tasks and activities you performed at each organization in Column F. This also includes tools and processes involved with each role, and you can probably lift most of this information from your resume or LinkedIn profile.


Now it's time to assign all these tasks and activities to various Zones of Competence. You'll want to be extremely honest with yourself here. In most cases you should have a handful of activities in your Zone of Genius, a few more in your Zone of Excellence, and even more in the remaining zones.You can see the example from your worksheet below.Based on the example above, this person could become a consultant who helps organizations plan their Facebook ad campaigns. We'll go deeper into potential service offerings next.

I created the A.C.T.I.O.N. business ideation model to help you quickly determine which services you'd like to offer.Audits


These can be scary if we're talking about your taxes, but they're extremely beneficial if you provide them as service to organizations or individuals. Based on your zone of genius, this is the step-by-step approach you'll use to analyze a company or process. Your main goal here is to identify areas of improvement or opportunity.Need help creating your audit? Watch this step-by-step video I created.ConsultingThis involves providing your opinions, analyses, and recommendations to organizations or individuals based on your own expertise. Fortunately, you can use the same process that you already created for your audit.


TrainingYou'll help individuals or organizations develop the specific skills needed to perform their job. This is different from consulting, but it's somewhat related. Maybe during your audit or consulting you discovered they need to start leveraging a new process, but they don't currently know how to. That's where you come in to provide training.ImplementationThis is where you help your clients implement the tools or teams needed to achieve their goals. It could be onboarding a new tool or even selecting the right vendor to partner with.


Ongoing RetainersThis is one of my favorite ways to make money. With retainers you continue providing advice and services based on your area of expertise. But you may not have a specific project you're working on. You're just there to answer questions whenever they arise. I strongly recommend offering retainers at the end of any project so you can continue generating revenue from your clients.New OpportunitiesBy design this is the most flexible part of the model. What ideas can you come up with based on the organization, their goals and creative ways you can help them reach their desired outcome?


I'll give you an example here. I make educational videos focused on entrepreneurship for one of my business partners. But I recently pitched them on a new opportunity, which is setting up an accountability program for all their program participants. This is aligned with my previous work and their mission so they were receptive to the idea.So that's A.C.T.I.O.N. business ideation model. You can pick one or all of these, but I highly recommend offering audits since it establishes the baseline for all your other service offerings.Next up, we'll cover promoting your business.Realted: How Networking Is Necessary for Effective Entrepreneurship


Ask your network to spread the word about your businessI've interviewed hundreds of entrepreneurs, and 90 percent of their first clients came from their network. So before you start posting on social media begging strangers to work with you, start with the people who already know, like and trust you.Think of 10-20 people you know who can spread the word about your new business. This includes previous coworkers, friends and relatives. Ideally, these individuals would have access to a relevant network. Meaning they may know people or organizations that could use your services.Then, you're going to reach out to them and ask for their help. Here's a template you start with.Hey Omar,Hope all is well on your end.Reaching out to let you know that I've started a new business and I'm wondering if you could help me spread the word.In short, I help (target audience), (take this action) so they can (achieve a specific outcome)Would you happen to know of any individuals or companies that would be interested in this service? If so, I'd appreciate it if you could introduce us or just forward this email. 


Thanks for your support!You can send this message via email or messaging, whichever makes the most sense for you based on your relationship.Next stepsEntrepreneurship is challenging, but it doesn't have to be confusing. By following this process you'll be able to make money, save time and avoid burnout.If you don't get leads within the first seven days I suggest reaching out to more people in your network using the same message. This is most likely how you'll get your first client, so stick with it.

We've all heard about burnout. It's that all-too-familiar sensation of being trapped in a never-ending cycle of stress, exhaustion and overwork.But what if I told you there's something sneakier, stealthier and often more devastating lurking in the shadows of our careers? It's called ""rust out,"" a silent career killer that thrives in the mundane, the uninspiring and the unfulfilling.Here's the lowdown on this workplace phenomenon, what it is and how it differs from burnout. Let's explore why rust-out affects some groups more than others and provide best practices for managing and combating rust-out.



It's time to shine a light on this career saboteur and empower ourselves to break free from its insidious grip.Related: 3 Insights From the First Large-Scale Study on Burnout and Entrepreneurs


What is rust-out?Rust-out is the feeling of uninterest and disconnection from your work. It occurs when the tasks you're doing fail to challenge your skills and abilities, leaving you feeling listless, apathetic and bored. Some telltale signs include:A constant sense of disinterest in your work.Decreased enthusiasm for new challenges.Frequent irritability with colleagues or tasks.A perception that your daily routine has lost its spark.A persistent feeling of professional stagnation and unfulfillment.While we focus on avoiding burnout, we might unknowingly expose ourselves to the silent killer of rust-out — a career corroded by monotony and boredom. Rust-out may not scream at you like burnout, but its impact is just as devastating.Who is most affected by rust-out?Rust-out doesn't discriminate, but it seems to have a particular affinity for women. In an era when we champion gender equality and diversity, it's disheartening to see women bearing the disproportionate burden of its consequences.While working in the city, I often felt the weight of an unfair burden, having to outwork my male colleagues for the same career progress. This sense of injustice can take a toll and gradually lead to uninspired feelings as if I'm slowly rusting away.


It's not just my experience. A recent study highlighted that women are consistently judged to have less leadership potential than their male counterparts, resulting in a 14% lower likelihood of promotion each year. Given that women tend to stay in entry to mid-level positions longer than their male counterparts, they'll likely eventually feel unchallenged and become less enthusiastic about their roles.Additionally, what may surprise some is how common rust-out is among those who embark on the entrepreneurial journey. It's not uncommon for passionate founders to start with grand visions of building something exceptional, only to realize that they've inadvertently created a never-ending job for themselves rather than the fulfilling and liberating enterprise they had in mind. This underscores that rust-out isn't confined to corporate careers. It can silently affect entrepreneurs as well.Related: How to Spot Entrepreneurial Burnout (Before It's Too Late)Best practices for managing rust-outIf this is hitting home and you're recognizing the signs of rust-out, there's hope. Drawing from my experience as a mentor with Virgin Startups, here's the advice I offer my mentees grappling with rust-out. These proactive steps can help you regain your enthusiasm for your career.


Embrace your reality:As the saying goes, you must understand your problems to solve them. Rust-out is no exception. It's important to acknowledge that sense of disconnection and monotony that seeped into your work. By recognizing this challenge, you take the first vital step to reclaim your professional enthusiasm.One thing that really helped me was maintaining a work journal. Pouring your thoughts and daily experiences onto its pages can be a powerful tool for uncovering patterns and identifying the factors contributing to your rust out.You can also talk to someone you trust — a friend, colleague or mentor. Sharing your experiences can provide valuable insights and emotional support as you navigate the complexities of rust-out.Finally, take some time to reflect on your values. Are they in harmony with your current work situation, or is there a misalignment? This assessment can reveal whether your rust out stems from a values disconnect.


Discover what fulfills you:Your self-audit isn't merely about identifying rust-out triggers; it's also an opportunity to unearth new interests and sources of excitement that can reignite your professional passion. So, why not add these newfound interests to your plate?Sometimes, when you're deep in the throes of rust-out, it can be challenging to pinpoint what truly excites you. In these moments, take a step back to a time before you entered the workforce, perhaps even back to your childhood. What did you genuinely enjoy doing? Did you relish helping your family prepare dinner? If so, consider enrolling in a cooking class. Were you a passionate dancer during your school days? Maybe it's time to explore joining a dance team. And if, like me, you're fueled by a desire to help others, think about mentorship or volunteering as a way to reignite your sense of purpose.Take charge:To conquer rust-out effectively, you've got to seize the reins and take charge. Start by setting new professional goals that excite and challenge you. Seek out projects that reignite your passion, or consider whether changing your career path is the bold move you need.Don't go it alone. Engage in open conversations with your supervisor or confide in a trusted mentor. Their insights and guidance can be invaluable in helping you navigate and control your rust out. Remember, taking the initiative to tackle rust-out head-on is a testament to your resilience and determination. You can transform this challenge into an opportunity for personal and professional growth.

It's time to shed light on this career saboteur and take action.Remember, your career is too important to let rust-out hold you back. So, if you're feeling like you're rusting out, this could be your wake-up call to identify areas that require change and embrace this discomfort as a catalyst for personal and professional growth.

90,Working From Home With Your Newborn? Use These 6 Tips to Keep Your Sanity,"Dec 12, 2023",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/working-at-home-with-a-newborn-6-tips-to-stay-sane/464733,"
Leaving the hospital with a newborn is always a nerve-wracking experience, no matter if it is your first child or fifth. There are so many things to think about: diapers, feeding times, baths … and for moms who choose to work at home with their kids, they have to think about how they will juggle their career and a newborn. The constant demands of caring for a tiny human can make it difficult to find time for work, let alone stay focused on the tasks at hand.After working with my own kids at home and helping countless other moms do the same, I've come up with a few tips to help.Related: 5 Ways to Shift Your Morning Mindset as a Mompreneur and Be More Productive



1. Work around your babyIt is important to establish a routine with your baby. Always keep nap times, feeding times, etc. on a schedule. This will keep your child on track, and it will also allow you to create a work schedule for yourself. When you put your newborn down to nap, plan on squeezing in some work. To stay productive, plan on working in short bursts.2. Communicate with your teamIf you were up all night and do not feel as though you will be able to work the next day, let your team know! Working remotely often allows for flexible scheduling, so you may just need to let your team know you will be working later in the day after your own nap.


3. Use the tools available to youThere are quite a few great products on the market that can keep your baby secure and entertained while you are able to work; many products come equipped with enrichment toys and sounds that are sure to keep your baby occupied while you send off a few work emails.4. Ask for helpNever be afraid to ask for help. Running on very little sleep with a newborn can easily lead to increased stress and meltdowns. Ask friends and family to step in. Look for support groups in your area where you can vent some frustrations. Search online for resources that can help. You are not alone on this journey of motherhood, and so many others have experienced the exact same things you are currently experiencing. I cannot emphasize this point enough! You are not alone.Related: How Employers Can Help Working Parents Navigate Back-to-School Season5. Be flexibleNothing will ever go as planned, especially with a newborn. Be prepared to be flexible in both your job and your care of your child. Some days, bath time might have to be later or earlier than planned. On other days, your meetings might need to be moved around because your child needs a little extra playtime. Just be sure to be clear and communicate with your coworkers and/or clients.


6. Prioritize yourself, tooMost importantly, do not forget to take care of yourself. Parenthood is a demanding role, and it's important to prioritize self-care while juggling work and caring for a newborn. The first rule of self-care is to make sure to prioritize sleep. Lack of sleep can greatly impact your productivity and overall well-being, so try to establish a bedtime routine and create a sleep-friendly environment. Easier said than done with a newborn, but with the right support system behind you, it can be accomplished; ask friends or family to watch your baby while you squeeze in a nap or arrange your schedule so that you also nap when your baby naps.Additionally, take breaks throughout the day to recharge and relax. Whether it's a quick walk outside or a few minutes of deep breathing, these breaks can help reduce stress and improve focus. This can even include just spending a few extra minutes playing with your child.Don't forget to nourish your body with healthy meals and stay hydrated. Fueling yourself properly will give you the energy you need to tackle your responsibilities. Keep healthy snacks around or foods that are easy to grab and go as you will often be on the move with a baby — something first-time parents often overlook is that you will have your baby in one hand while trying to feed yourself with the other. Find foods that are nutritious but easy to handle while you care for your little one.Related: 4 Ways Your Company Can Radically Help Working Mothers


Finally, don't neglect your mental health. Find time for activities you enjoy and make time for self-reflection and self-care practices such as journaling or meditation. This is another area where support groups can help as well. Sometimes all you need are some fellow parents that you can vent to who understand exactly what you are going through! While doing this in person can provide a great bonding experience, it can be difficult to get out of the house when you have a baby. In the age of the internet, you can also find these groups online where you can visit virtually on your schedule. No matter what your preference is, it cannot be stated enough that reaching out to others at this time will be of great help to you.In the end, raising a newborn will look different for everyone. Find what works for you and your child, and never be afraid to ask for help.

      Key Takeaways    



        I've gotten some great career advice over 35 years in the workforce.
      


        I've also gotten the worst advice ever.
      


        The best advice? ""Make it happen.""
      



















Tim Knox; iStock; Rebecca Zisser/Business Insider


This article originally appeared on Business Insider. Over the past 35 years, I've been the lucky and grateful recipient of some excellent career advice.Such as:



""Ride your strengths."" Bad bosses and career advisers will often tell you that, to succeed, you should ""improve your weaknesses."" This is crap. Instead, you should improve your strengths — what you are naturally good at relative to others — and work your way into jobs and careers that take advantage of them. Jobs and careers are competitive. You need every edge you can get.""Be the CEO of your career."" This is my summary of the advice I gleaned from a bunch of career books I read in the public library in my mid-20s when I was trying to figure out why I was lost and flailing and what I could do about it. It's a reminder that there is only one person in charge of your career: You.""Kiss the ring."" At one of my early jobs, I did a bad job. Worse, I blamed my boss! (How could he ask me to do such mindless, menial tasks? I went to Yale!). Not surprisingly, this led my boss to sit me down and tell me that I had a bad attitude. Well, I wanted to set my boss straight. But fortunately, before I did, a mentor gave me the wise advice above. It saved my job.I've also gotten lousy career advice, including this:""Follow your bliss.""The idea with this one is that, if you do what you love, the money will follow. Maybe that works for some people. It sure didn't for me.


I can't blame anyone for giving me that advice because I read it in an an interview with Joseph Campbell. Campbell was a professor at Sarah Lawrence who dropped out of graduate school and spent five years reading mythology in a rented shack in the woods. Doing that, apparently, was Campbell's ""bliss."" For him, it led to an inspiring career.My problem was that I didn't know what my ""bliss"" was. I also had more pressing concerns — namely, the need to eat and pay rent. Also, as I began trying to find jobs, I realized that despite my Ivy League education, I didn't really know how to do anything.So better advice for me at that time would have been: Just get a job you think you might not hate, learn some skills, and go from there.The best adviceThe best career advice I ever got, meanwhile, came from one of my first bosses on Wall Street, an investment banker named Jonathan Morgan.Jonathan's advice — delivered as a command — was this:""Make it happen.""Jonathan would often say this after I pitched him some idea for how we could do something better.What he meant was:""That sounds like a fine idea. But ideas are a dime a dozen — what matters is execution. I'm busy, and I don't have a bunch of minions hanging around waiting to do stuff. So if you want that idea to become reality, well, make it happen.""


Like ""be the CEO of your career,"" this advice reminded me that, if I wanted to make positive changes in the world — in my job, my career, my company, my community, or my life — no one was going to make them happen but me.This advice was empowering. It gave me the freedom to figure out and do what needed to be done. It was also sobering. Because it placed the responsibility for doing it where it belonged — with me.Want to change your job, career, life, community, or world for the better?Great!Make it happen.

92,How Stay-at-Home Moms Can Reignite Their Career and Re-enter the Workforce,"Dec 4, 2023",Lesley Pyle,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-stay-at-home-moms-can-reignite-their-career-and/464732,"
When I had my first child, I had a difficult decision to make: Do I stay home with my child, or do I put them in daycare while I work? Staying home sounded nice, but my family needed the income from both myself and my husband — especially with a newborn on the way. However, missing some of those crucial first moments with my child made me incredibly sad. What if I missed their first steps or their first words?With the support of my loving husband, I decided to make my own way and work from home while raising a child. It was not easy, but I was determined to make it work. We made many sacrifices, but I count them all worth it. But unfortunately, many other women choose to step away from the workforce completely, not knowing what options are available.Once the kids are grown and able to take care of themselves, that leaves many women wanting to return to their careers. A great way to do this is through a returnship — something that was not an option when I had my first child.



Related: On Momternships: Do Working Moms Really Need to Start From Scratch?Understanding what a returnship isA returnship is a unique opportunity designed for individuals who have taken a break from their careers and are looking to re-enter the workforce. It combines aspects of an internship and a full-time job, offering valuable work experience and a chance to update skills in a supportive environment. Unlike traditional internships, returnships are tailored for professionals with prior experience, allowing them to showcase their talents and bridge the gap in their resumes.


A returnship is for anyone who took a career break, but this arrangement can be particularly beneficial for busy moms who have taken time off to raise their children and are now ready to jump back into their careers. You can showcase all your previous experience, but you can also showcase what you've learned from being a mom which can include prioritizing, meeting deadlines and staying organized.The pros and cons of a returnship for working mothersReturnships can offer many benefits for working mothers looking to re-enter the workforce. On the positive side, a returnship provides a structured and supportive environment to refresh and update skills that may have been dormant during a career break. It allows moms to gain relevant work experience, build new connections and showcase their talents to potential employers.Returnships also offer a chance to ease back into the professional world, providing a smoother transition from being a stay-at-home mom to a working professional. However, there can be downsides, too. Returnships may come with lower pay or limited opportunities for career advancement compared to regular positions; remember, at the end of the day, these are essentially internships and are treated as such. However, they provide a wonderful way for you to dip your toe back into the workforce, so to speak.Related: Make Yours a Mom-friendly Business


Preparing yourself for a successful returnshipReturning to the workforce after a career break can be both exciting and daunting, especially for busy moms. To ensure a successful returnship experience, it's important to take some steps to prepare yourself. Working exclusively with moms, I can offer a few key words of advice if you are preparing to apply for a returnship.First, update your skills and knowledge by enrolling in relevant courses or workshops. Take advantage of online resources and professional development opportunities to stay current in your industry. I understand that you may have a tight budget — there are many great resources online that are free through big names you already know about like YouTube and LinkedIn. Find what works best for you on your schedule.Next, revamp your résumé and online presence to highlight your experience and skills. Tailor your résumé to fit the requirements of the returnship program or position you're interested in; this needs to be done for each position for which you apply. For example, if you apply for a marketing position, highlight relevant skills such as meeting deadlines. Then if you also apply for an accounting position, highlight skills such as attention to detail.It never hurts to research the company offering the job and include some information in your application materials about them — this shows you are serious and spent time finding more details about the business. Additionally, in the age of social media, many companies will check your socials during the interview process. Take some time to update them and look at them through a professional lens.

You can find some of the most popular questions online with a quick search. Ask a family member or friend for help and have them stand in as the interviewer so you can practice with a real person. Remember to maintain eye contact. Be truthful about your experience; it is okay if you do not know the answer to a question! Just let the interviewer know you are not sure, but bring the question back to your relevant skills for the position.If you are a busy mom looking to transition back into the workforce, then a returnship can be the perfect solution for you. They allow you to gain relevant skills, polish up some old ones and get you on the path back to a full-time career.

Liza Anderson, now founder of Anderson Group Public Relations, got her start in PR more than 20 years ago working for Warren Cowan of Rogers and Cowan. ""Considered the godfather of PR,"" Cowan was one of the first to represent Hollywood icons like Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor outside of the studio system in the 1950s, Anderson says.Needless to say, a lot has changed in the decades since Anderson's early PR days. Back then, she was ""literally Xeroxing press kits and mailing them to reporters and television producers"" to secure interviews for clients.Related: What Is an Organic Growth Formula, and How Can It Help Your Business?



Entrepreneur sat down with the industry veteran to learn more about navigating today's media landscape successfully, whether you're new to the game or an established player.""What do you want people to see when they type your name in Google?""First, for newcomers: When trying to figure out if you need professional PR services at all, consider if you're at the point where you want more visibility — and see others in similar places getting attention already, Anderson says.""What do you want people to see when they type your name in Google?"" she adds. ""Let's create those headlines together. [It's time for PR] when you have anything — whether it's yourself, a product, a project that you're proud of — that you want to make noise [in our] crowded world.""Related: Should You Hire Your Own Publicist? How to Stay Relevant in an Ever-Changing Business Landscape.Of course, one of the most significant transformations in PR over the years has been the rise of the internet and social media, which add additional layers of complexity for anyone hoping to boost their image and can make it more difficult for PR professionals to forge the strong client relationships to help them do it, Anderson says.


""You were a bit more connected in a very strange way,"" Anderson says of the pre-social-media era. ""You had to call your client to tell them what was going on, whereas now, I'm always saying in my Zoom staff meeting, 'Pick up the phone and call your client. You can email and text them, but there's nothing like a good old-fashioned phone call.'""""It's [about] finding those little nuggets and those things that [make] you go, 'Oh, this would be a great angle.'""Despite the shifting media landscape, which includes the proliferation of influencers and AI (and, as it turns out, handsomely paid AI-generated influencers), some tricks of the trade do remain the same. The No. 1 most important way to determine if a PR specialist or firm is the right fit for you — or, alternatively, that you can actually help a given client — hasn't changed much over the years.""You have to put your heart into what you do,"" Anderson says. ""When you're representing a client or a brand, you have to find the things that you love about them, the things that make you excited about working with them.""


And that remains consistent no matter how big or small a person or brand happens to be.""I'm always taking meetings with people I don't know,"" Anderson says. ""It's [about] finding those little nuggets and those things that [make] you go, 'Oh, this would be a great angle. This is what makes them special. This is why they're so unique.' And it's no different than any relationship you have in real life.""Related: I Accidentally Became a Successful Entrepreneur.

I don't know if a computer is able to do that quite yet.""PR can help you get on people's radars for the right reasons — but it can be just as important when things go wrong. Having a PR professional guide your next steps when you find yourself at the center of a controversy can be invaluable. When facing backlash of any kind, the first question to consider is this, Anderson says: How did it get to this point?That's because the most effective PR approach hinges on if the person or brand experiencing backlash was a bystander or an active contributor to the events leading up to the controversy, Anderson explains. Based on that information, you can ""come up with a game plan"" — perhaps one that begins with a sincere apology or taking a step back, depending on the situation.It's clear that some PR secrets withstand the test of time — even two-plus decades' worth filled with ever-evolving technologies and trends — and Anderson's had a front-row seat through it all. But when it comes to how the industry might continue to grow and change over the next several years or decades, even seasoned experts like Anderson don't have a reliable crystal ball.Related: Why Is Your Competitor Getting News Coverage When You're Better Than Them?

""People are going to be able to come up with their own articles and just place them on their own TV shows. I can see it happening in so many different ways, where I don't even know if we'll exist 10 years from now. I hope so.

94,"I Made More Than $200,000 From My Freelancing Business in One Year. These Are the 3 Things I Did to Scale Up.","Nov 28, 2023",Hannah Logsdon,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/she-makes-six-figures-as-a-full-time-freelancer-heres-how/466036,"
This article originally appeared on Business Insider. I discovered freelancing while working a job in real-estate acquisitions, which I was unhappy at. I wanted a fulfilling career, and freelancing looked like a way to escape my 9-to-5 and carve out my own path to success.I quit my job in late 2020 and started freelancing as a virtual assistant and appointment setter on Upwork and Fiverr. I experienced both financial growth and personal fulfillment in a short span of time.



Within four months, I was earning enough to cover most of my bills and felt comfortable freelancing full time. In my first full calendar year, I earned $100,000 in revenue, and in my second year, I more than doubled that number. Here's how I did it.I was at a crossroads at the real-estate-acquisitions companyWhile working my 9-to-5, I didn't have a work-life balance and felt that my efforts went largely unrecognized by my manager and team. When a family tragedy struck, and I felt like I had to put work before being there for my loved ones, I knew I needed a way out.


Freelancing offered me the flexibility I craved. As I delved into social-media communities and online articles about freelancing, I learned about its low entry barrier and unparalleled autonomy.Since I lacked skills in graphic design and website development, I leaned into the strengths I'd cultivated while working in real estate: cold calling, lead generation, appointment setting, and virtual assisting. When advertising these skills on freelance marketplaces, I positioned myself as an expert in sales optimization, client acquisition, and virtual assistance.Starting out wasn't easy, and I faced many challenges, particularly in securing a consistent stream of clients.I decided to take a multifaceted approach, and in addition to using platforms, I recognized the power of personal connections. Conversations with friends and family not only fostered a supportive network but also often resulted in valuable referrals and business leads.


I also started cold calling. Over time, I built a reputation for delivering high-quality work, which set the stage for my business to grow.I started hiring help 4 months inI decided to bring on a team. Initially, I hired seven employees to tackle administrative tasks and handle cold-calling responsibilities. Then I discovered automation tools that reshaped our operational efficiency and realized a smaller, dedicated group could adeptly handle the evolving demands of the business.By cutting the team down and harnessing the power of automation, we achieved a level of productivity that allowed us to focus on quality service while maintaining financial stability. This was pivotal in optimizing our workflow and positioned the business for sustained success.At the end of my first year of freelancing, I generated over $100,000 in revenue. As I entered my second year of freelancing in 2022, I was determined to double my sales, so I employed some specific strategies.


Upselling and cross-selling: enhancing value for existing clientsRather than seeing a completed project as the end of client engagement, I saw it as an opportunity to offer more services. For example, if I had initially assisted a client with cold calling and lead generation, I would explore ways to further support their sales efforts, such as offering follow-up appointment setting or refining a sales pitch.By understanding my clients' ongoing needs and tailoring my offerings to address them, I transitioned from being a one-time service provider to a long-term partner invested in their growth.Niche targeting: capturing underserved marketsI identified underserved, niche clients such as real-estate agencies and graphic- and website-design firms. Then I tailored my services to cater to them. This set me apart from more generalized service providers.For example, by crafting my services to align with the unique challenges tech startups faced — including lead-generation difficulty and client retention — I became a sought-after resource in that niche.


Premium offerings: elevating the client experienceAs my reputation and client base grew, and I expanded beyond freelancing platforms onto my own website, I realized the potential to offer premium service packages. These catered to clients seeking a higher level of customization, personalization, and hands-on support.Premium service packages could include exclusive consultation sessions, dedicated account management, in-depth market research, and comprehensive reporting. This strategy not only allowed me to command a higher price point for my services but also demonstrated my commitment to going above and beyond to meet my clients' needs.I tapped into a segment of clients willing to invest more for exceptional value and a heightened level of service. Doing so led directly to increased revenue.Using these strategies, my business revenue for my second full year surpassed $200,000.

97,Thanksgiving Is One of Few Paid Holidays U.S. Workers Have Off. They're Not Grateful for Stingy Vacation Policies — and the Breaking Point Is Near.,"Nov 21, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/stingy-paid-holidays-exacerbate-us-work-life-imbalance/465688,"
The U.S. comes in second on the list of 10 countries offering the least amount of paid vacation time, according to a report from career-resource platform Resume.io. In the private sector, American employees receive 10 days of PTO on average, not including holidays and sick days — a shockingly low number compared to those in other developed nations.In many countries around the world, particularly those in Europe, it's not uncommon for employees to take vacations for months at a time, in many cases due to the European Union Working Time Directive, which requires a minimum of 20 working days of paid vacation in all EU countries, CNBC reported.Related: How to Determine Your PTO Policy



""In the U.S., it is estimated that less than 50% of workers who get paid vacation time use their full allotment each year.""""[The disparity] has largely been driven by American business resisting any kind of mandate to provide paid time off for workers,"" Joe Mull, a 20-year HR veteran and author of the new book Employalty: How to Ignite Commitment and Keep Top Talent in the New Age of Work, tells Entrepreneur. ""For more than 100 years, all proposed national laws guaranteeing paid leave to workers have failed to pass. In nearly every other developed nation on earth, workers are guaranteed paid time off.""


Thanksgiving is around the corner in the U.S., and although 39% of private industry workers nationwide will have the day off, most of them aren't grateful for the stingy vacation policies their employers subject them to year-round. And even those lucky enough to have more PTO at their disposal are tired of being unable to use it.Related: These Are the 10 Countries With the Least Paid Vacation — and Where the U.S. Ranks Might Surprise You""In the U.S., it is estimated that less than 50% of workers who get paid vacation time use their full allotment each year,"" Mull says. ""The most common reason given for not taking vacation time is fear of falling behind at work."" And many other workers feel they must reserve paid vacation time for when ""life happens,"" including issues surrounding childcare and elder care, sickness, transportation and more, he adds.""A functioning society with optimal mental health requires periods of rest and restoration.""What's at stake if the U.S. doesn't catch up? According to Mull, a lot: American employers can expect continuing high levels of burnout (77% of U.S. professionals have experienced burnout at their current job, per a Deloitte survey) and will struggle to attract and retain top talent.""Much of the turmoil in the labor market in recent years has been driven by employees changing jobs in pursuit of better quality of life,"" Mull says. ""So the business case here is that employers reduce employee churn and deliver better products and services to customers when they have a full complement of healthy, engaged employees.""Related: 3 Truths About Unlimited PTO — Why Employees Are Worse Off With Endless Vacation DaysBut there's an even bigger issue at play, Mull warns: ""A functioning society with optimal mental health requires periods of rest and restoration, and our current culture around work and paid time off doesn't support this.""


""It's a symptom of several larger issues related to rising workloads, childcare deficiencies and more.""Mull compares the plight of U.S. workers to an engine that's been racing at maximum RPMs for long periods of time — ""eventually, it gives out."" That's why time away from work, and the restoration it provides, actually makes for more productive employees and better work outcomes, he says.""What's important to note here is that it's not just about offering more vacation time,"" Mull adds. ""Employers must create the conditions that allow employees to actually use it. In many ways, the rate at which we take vacation time isn't the problem — it's a symptom of several larger issues related to rising workloads, childcare deficiencies and more.""

Many Gen Z workers entered the workforce during the pandemic, when remote work and virtual meetings were the norm.Now, as work transitions back to hybrid models and in-office requirements, the younger generation is feeling the heat as it experiences commuting and cubicle life for the first time.In a clip that's been viewed more than eight million times, TikToker @brielleybelly123 posted a tearful confession about adjusting to a typical 9-5 schedule after graduating college. She said that there's ""no way"" that she would be able to afford to live in the city where she works, so she must commute every day.



@brielleybelly123im also getting sick leave me alone im emotional ok i feel 12 and im scared of not having time to live♬ original sound - BRIELLE""The 9-5 schedule, in general, is crazy,"" she told viewers. ""Being in office 9-5, like if it was remote, you get off at five, and you're home, and everything's fine. But like I'm not home, it takes me long to get home. I know it could be worse. I know I could be working longer, but I literally get off; it's pitch black — I don't have energy. How do you have friends?""


Related: Why Hybrid Work Will Win Out Over Remote and In-PersonThe TikToker lamented about her nearly 12-hour day door-to-door and having no desire to work out, cook or socialize after she arrives home.People were conflicted in the comment section, with some agreeing that the 9-5 is an antiquated work model that needs re-assessing, calling it ""depressing"" and ""repetitive.""""[A] 40-hour work week was designed with a homemaker to take care of house tasks,"" one person pointed out. ""We need dual incomes now, so that's not possible. No time for anything.""


""It's soul-crushing,"" another agreed. ""Like honestly feels like a prison sentence.""Others, however, were less sympathetic to the TikToker and tried to explain to her that this is the reality of the American work life.""Welcome to adulthood,"" one said bluntly.""Ok Gen X here and this cracks me up,"" another offered. ""I did a full-time job and 2 part-time jobs while going to college full-time. I'm on call now 24/7. 9-5 is amazing.""


Gen Z encompasses all people born between the years 1997 and 2012, who are currently projected to account for roughly 27% of the global workforce by 2025.Related: Our Brains Will Never Be The Same Again After Remote WorkThough the TikToker's reaction to her new life schedule was met with divided opinions from viewers, the notion of not wanting to opt-in to a five-day workweek in-office is not unheard of.According to a recent report by Forbes, a whopping 65% of workers prefer a remote work schedule, while 32% prefer a hybrid model.

The five-day workweek, the U.S. standard since the Great Depression, might be coming to an end.Nowadays, 92% of young people say they want a four-day workweek so badly that they're willing to give up other professional perks for it, according to a new Bankrate survey reported by CNBC Make It.Related: Why You Need to Consider Implementing the 4-Day Workweek



Perhaps the biggest sacrifice young professionals are willing to make? Saying goodbye to remote and hybrid schedules: One-third of Gen Z and millennial workers say they'd accept a fully in-person role if they could tack an extra day onto their weekends, per the survey.That might come as a surprise to some, considering how divisive return-to-office policies are. Although some CEOs and senior leaders frequently push for more in-person days, their remote and hybrid employees who have to commute aren't always on the same page.


In fact, Gen Z and millennials value remote and hybrid work so much that three-quarters of them working in remote or hybrid roles would consider finding a new job if their employer requested they go on-site full-time, according to a recent Deloitte report.Related: This Is What It's Actually Like to Work a 4-Day WorkweekBut they'll do it for a shorter workweek. And they'll make additional sacrifices for it, too, the Bankrate survey found, including working longer hours (48%), changing jobs or companies (35%), working weekends or evenings (27%) and even taking a pay cut (13%).Many Gen X and boomer workers are also interested in a four-day workweek, and they're even more willing (61%) to work longer hours to make that a reality, per the survey.

102,Dismantling the 9 to 5 — Why Job Stacking Is the Future of Work,"Oct 31, 2023",Zach Wade,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/dismantling-the-9-to-5-why-job-stacking-is-the-future/459302,"
The American workplace is undergoing a paradigm shift — one that labor economists should be reluctant to dismiss as a fake trend. As work-life balance is being redefined, a majority of Americans are expressing disdain for the traditional Monday through Friday, 9 to 5 job regime.Instead, many Americans are yearning for a professional life that offers more flexibility and autonomy. Remote workers, having tasted the fruits of working from home, are steadfast in their refusal to return to the conventional office setup. Meanwhile, the four-day work week, pioneered by nations like Iceland and Japan, is gradually gaining traction in corporate circles. Yet as the evolution in the work sphere continues, a new trend is emerging for millennials and Gen Z, who have been vociferously demanding a revolutionary work model since their initiation into the workforce. This burgeoning trend is none other than job stacking.Related: A Gen Xer Who Secretly Works 3 Full-Time Remote Jobs and Makes $344,000 Paid Off His Mortgage and Is Saving to Send His Kids to College Debt-Free



What is job stacking?Job stacking is the practice of concurrently working multiple full-time jobs simultaneously, accruing more than one full-time salary. This approach to work diversifies income streams and maximizes earning potential, and has been adopted by over 400,000 Americans, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.My personal tryst with job stacking commenced in 2020 at only age 22. As I plunged into this novel work model, I found myself adeptly handling five different job roles and amassing a staggering annual income of over $375,000. This venture propelled me into a space of financial freedom and allowed me to save the funds to kickstart my agency.


In a scenario where over 70% of the workforce finds themselves discontented in their jobs, the concept of job stacking resonates strongly with those who aspire to reclaim control over their time without compromising on their income and benefits. At its core, job stacking entails juggling multiple job roles, often across various domains, to create a lucrative and satisfying work mosaic that caters to the diverse interests and skills of an individual.Why is job stacking becoming a preferred choice among Americans? Let's delve into the dynamics that are fostering the adoption of this model:1. Facilitating balanced parentingOne of the most profound impacts of job stacking is on the parenting front. Rigid work schedules have been a long-standing issue for working parents. Flexibility is a top-ranking employee benefit for both men and women, but parents with young children are more likely to rate it as one of the top-ranking employee benefits. If flexibility were not available, 38% of working parents would have quit their jobs or reduced their hours. Job stacking comes as a savior in this context, providing parents with the liberty to tailor their work hours to suit their family commitments. Furthermore, the financial benefits accrued from multiple job roles can significantly offset the childcare costs, which currently hover around $10,600 per year.Related: Why Working Multiple Jobs Will Be the New Normal


2. Empowering employees to lead a fulfilling lifeAs mental health has become more of a priority, many full-time workers are trying to live a fulfilling lifestyle beyond the weekends. Gone are the days of employees' existence being confined to the boundaries of an office. Recent Deloitte research shows that millennials and Gen Zers are desperately seeking work-life balance, even placing it at the top of their consideration list when selecting a company to work for. Job stacking serves as the golden key to unlocking this lifestyle. By mastering time management skills, individuals can sculpt a work-life structure that allows for ample personal time to pursue travel and other fulfilling endeavors, defining ""after work"" on their own terms.3. A counter to underpayment by employersA grim reality facing the American workforce is the issue of underpayment. A large faction of employees feel that the remuneration offered by companies is inadequate to sustain a decent quality of life, especially given the escalating cost of living and real estate prices. Job stacking emerges as a potent solution to this dilemma, empowering individuals to supplement their primary income with earnings from various other roles, thereby elevating their financial standing.What makes for an excellent job stack?Not all jobs are stackable. Obviously, it's impossible to job stack jobs like working at call centers or being a barista. To succeed at job stacking, look for jobs with a few key characteristics, the first being that the job is completely remote. Industries like information technology (IT), customer service, writing/content creation and digital marketing tend to have a significant remote workforce, making those easy roles to stack. Aim for in-house positions, which typically offer better control over your workload. Roles that require extensive management are less ideal for stacking across various companies.Focus on securing mid-level positions, as they present an optimal balance of responsibility and compensation, often offering salaries exceeding $40,000 annually without the intense oversight inherent in higher-level roles. Additionally, prioritize finding positions that align with your existing skills and can be streamlined or automated, allowing you to perform at your best.

Moreover, it's difficult to feel financially secure when layoffs are occurring regularly. Job stacking and its multiple revenue streams offer an increased sense of financial security. But here's what's even better: It allows you to be selective in the roles you take on. This way, you have the ability to pursue jobs that you really love, leading to feelings of joy and fulfillment in your job. Having this sense of financial security and work-life satisfaction will ease anxiety and promote fulfillment.As we stand at the cusp of a work revolution, job stacking is emerging as a potent force that is equipped to dismantle the traditional work structures that have long dictated the American work landscape. As more and more individuals embrace this multi-faceted work approach, we are likely to witness a happier, more satisfied and more financially secure workforce that thrives on autonomy and flexibility.For those considering treading this path, remember that job stacking is not merely a career choice; it's a lifestyle, a movement that is empowering individuals to redefine success on their own terms, fostering a future where work harmoniously coexists with life's pleasures and pursuits. Embark on your job stacking journey today and be a part of the revolution that is setting a new benchmark for professional satisfaction and personal fulfillment.

103,Applying to Work at Major Companies on LinkedIn Can Feel Like a Shot in the Dark. Here's Where You Have the Best Chance — and the Worst.,"Oct 26, 2023",Amanda Breen,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/the-most-and-least-competitive-major-companies-for/464372,"
If you've ever wanted to work for one of your favorite companies — whether it be a tech giant like Apple or a fashion service like Stitch Fix — you might have navigated to its job posting on LinkedIn, seen that hundreds of applications were submitted within hours and wondered if you even had a shot.Not surprisingly, some of the biggest names in American business do tend to be the most competitive, but others aren't exactly flooded with applicants. In fact, despite a gradually cooling job market in the U.S., economists maintain that employees are in a great position to negotiate and job hop, CNBC reported earlier this year.Related: After 526 Rejected Job Applications, I Broke Through. So Can You.



So, what are your chances as an applicant at a household name company, really? What are the most — and least — competitive companies for job seekers? A new study from Resume.io set out to answer that question by analyzing data from LinkedIn.Based on the average number of daily job applicants to job postings, Resume.io determined the 20 companies where getting hired might be particularly difficult and the 20 where it might not be so hard after all.

You may have heard this one before. As you wait to interview for a new job, you hear the words, ""The Director of First Impressions will be with you shortly.""Traditionally, job titles have served as a way to quickly express the nature of an individual's work. However, companies have used more creative and grandiose titles in recent years in an effort to attract top talent, leading to job-title inflation. As an example, you will often find inaccurate job titles on LinkedIn.In most cases, it's pretty obvious how it works. Perhaps a company is trying to retain talent by offering a higher title without providing the responsibilities and pay that should accompany it. After being frustrated by uncredited work, a job seeker may devise a creative way to describe their last gig.

106,"How to Balance Compensation, Recognition and Quality of Life in Your Next Job or Venture","Oct 23, 2023",Marc Kravets,https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/how-to-balance-compensation-recognition-and-quality-of/463774,"
As the modern workspace evolves, employees are developing higher standards for their work engagements and are intent on aligning with organizations that share their values and respect them as more than an asset.In navigating through the course of our careers or entrepreneurial journeys, there's often a desire to find a perfect blend of compensation, recognition and a fulfilling lifestyle. Finding the balance between these three components presents a metaphor akin to what's mathematically referred to as the ""three utilities problem,"" though I've coined the term ""Triangle of Inequality.""As you are looking for your next venture or job opportunity, you need to run the triangle. No, not the triangle offense made famous by Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan, but rather this ""Triangle of Inequality"" — or rather, the Career Triangle, as I prefer to call it. This novel approach, from the game theory, used to weigh the decisions of your career, will allow you to take a clear look at what you are committing to and understand what the advantages and disadvantages are. This way, you can go forward with clear expectations or pass on an opportunity for a good reason.



Related: How to Make Career Decisions That You Will Never RegretA framework for balanced career decisionsThe Career Triangle has been guiding career decisions in my professional journey. Early in my career, my mentor illustrated a concept through a derivative of the three utilities problem — where Quality, Speed and Cost were the vertices. A simple yet profound lesson was that one could only pick two points at a time, implying a trade-off. For instance, achieving quality and speed in a project would undoubtedly hike the costs.


Translating this notion to career planning, the vertices change to Compensation, Recognition and Quality of Life. Everyone yearns for a role embodying all three: a lucrative paycheck, accolades for one's work and a rich personal life. However, the real-world scenario tends to be quite different, typically demanding a trade-off to keep the balance.Navigating the trade-offsAs you leverage the Career Triangle for your own professional decisions, consider the factors in play and the trade-off you are accepting based on which of the two vertices you choose. For high-compensation roles, the stakes are elevated. There is a surge of expectations, long working hours and a heightened sense of responsibility, with a thin margin for error. These positions, while financially rewarding, can cascade into burnout if not balanced well.On the other hand, roles with a spotlight of recognition come with their own set of challenges. The scrutiny intensifies, the pressure to maintain a pristine performance record escalates, and the competition for staying in the limelight could be fierce. In the quest for recognition, the balance between professional ambition and personal life could tilt unfavorably.And then there's the pursuit of quality of life — a term with fluid definitions as it resonates differently with each individual. It is about drawing clear boundaries between work and personal time and what one is willing to sacrifice to maintain this quality.


Related: 7 Factors That Could Make a Lower Salary a Better DealWhy can't you have it all?Taking all of this into consideration, it's impossible not to ask: Why can't you have it all? The response lies in the inherent trade-offs among these three vertices of the Career Triangle. High-stakes compensation roles may impede quality of life or overshadow the desire for recognition. Similarly, the pursuit of recognition might deter one's quality of life or might come at the expense of financial satisfaction.The equilibrium among these three is subjective and is dictated by individual priorities at different life stages. A fresh graduate might chase recognition and compensation over quality of life, whereas a mid-career professional might prioritize quality of life over the rest.Therefore, as you teeter on the cusp of your next job or venture, evaluating your priorities is imperative. Are you at a stage where financial reward supersedes the other vertices of the triangle? Or are you in pursuit of a balanced lifestyle, even if it means lesser recognition or financial gratification?


Embrace your pragmatismKnowing the sacrifices and the benefits each vertex offers prepares one to make informed decisions, which is crucial for professional growth and satisfaction. It demystifies the illusion of a ""perfect"" position and provides a pragmatic lens through which one can evaluate opportunities, making the complex realm of career decision-making more approachable.As you step into the realm of new possibilities, armed with the insights of the Career Triangle, the path may seem less daunting, instilling a sense of preparedness and confidence. The triangle does not preach a pessimistic view but rather underlines the importance of informed choices, showcasing the necessity of balance in professional pursuits. It is about embracing the journey with open eyes, understanding the sacrifices and being ready to pivot when life's priorities shift, thereby fostering a culture of adaptability.This nuanced perspective, acknowledging the Career Triangle, not only cultivates a mindset of growth but also nurtures resilience, an invaluable virtue as we traverse through the stages of our professional lives.Related: 10 Tips for Finding a Job That Will Make You Happy

A ""soft life,"" or one that values comfort and well-being above all else, is gaining traction among the younger generations — and impacting their retirement plans.Generation Z is particularly embracing ""soft saving,"" socking away less money for the future to spend more in the present, according to an Intuit Prosperity Index Study reported by CNBC Make It.Related: 3 Ways Gen Z CEOs are Crushing Stereotypes | Entrepreneur



Nowadays, young investors are funneling money into causes that align with their personal views and prioritizing a better quality of life over additional cash in savings accounts, the report found. They spend more on hobbies and non-essential purchases, like travel and entertainment, than Gen X and boomers.And it's leading some financial planners to issue warnings about the importance of balance.


""Spending money on things that truly make you happy is great … [but] people should satisfy their near-term needs and stay on track with their long-term goals before spending freely,"" Andy Reed, head of investor behavior at investment management firm Vanguard, told CNBC.Tim Melia, certified financial planner at Embolden Financial Planning LLC, shared a similar perspective with U.S. News & World Report: ""To be sure, a balance needs to be found. A sound financial plan needs to be in place to assure comfort and solvency in our later years. But that equation becomes different if people choose to work further into what were once traditional retirement years.""Related: 5 Simple Tips for Incorporating Gen Z Into Your WorkplaceBut it's not all bad news for young professionals: Gen Z and millennial savers who don't subscribe to the ""soft saving"" strategy might actually be on track for a better retirement than Gen X and baby boomers, thanks to increasing automatic enrollments in 401(k) plans.
